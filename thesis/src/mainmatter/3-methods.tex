\chapter{Data \& Methods}
\label{ch:methods}

\blockquote{This chapter describes the data used for this study, and how those data were analyzed. It covers the selection criteria for languages and lexemes, which corpora were used, and how the data were obtained and formatted. I also describe the methods used to annotate the data, and factors that influenced how the data were coded. I present and explain a measure of corpus dispersion that is used partly in place of, and partly as a complement to, raw frequencies of lexemes. Lastly, I set forth a procedure for operationalizing and quantifying lexical flexibility in a crosslinguistically comparable way. The formulation of this lexical flexibility measure is a key methodological contribution of this thesis.}
