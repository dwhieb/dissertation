\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

\blockquote{This chapter details the findings of the procedures described in \hyperref[ch:3-methods]{Chapter 3: Data \& Methods}. I begin with a brief examination of several representative lexical items from English and Nuuchahnulth, and explain to the reader how to interpret the ternary plots used to present results in this thesis. I then take an aggregate look at the behavior of lexical flexibility in English and Nuuchahnulth, first individually and then in comparison (\ref{R1}). Next, I present the results of the investigation of the relationship between degree of lexical flexibility and frequency / dispersion (\ref{R2}). Finally, I discuss the behavior of flexible items with respect to their semantics (\ref{R3}).}
