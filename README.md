# Dissertation

This repository contains the data and source code for my Ph.D. dissertation in linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

A self-imposed requirement for this project is that of empirical accountability and replicability. **This readme documents the steps to reproduce the results of this study,** whether using the same data employed in my dissertation, or a new data set entirely.

## 1. Introduction

The process of obtaining the results from this study, as in all empirical scientific studies, can be divided into several stages:

1. research questions
1. data selection
1. [data collection](#3-data-collection)
1. [data preparation](#4-data-preparation)
1. [data annotation](#5-data-annotation)
1. [data analysis](#6-data-analysis)
1. reporting results

There are not always clear boundaries between each stage (for example, a data selection step occurs at several places), but the above steps nonetheless provide a useful overview of the process.

This readme documents the _technical_ steps relating to [data collection](#3-data-collection), [data preparation](#4-data-preparation), [data annotation](#5-data-annotation) and [data analysis](#6-data-analysis). Discussion of the research questions, the decisions made during data annotation, and the results obtained may be found in my dissertation document, downloadable [here][dissertation].

## 2. Technical Prerequisites

### Cloning this Repository

This project and all its accompanying data and code are stored in a repository on [GitHub][GitHub]. In order to run the scripts in this project yourself, or use them with new data, you will need to clone this repository (copy it to your local computer), by following the instructions [here][cloning]. When this is done, all the necessary scripts will be on your computer, available for you to run.

### Running Scripts

While the inferential statistics and data visualization for this thesis were produced using the R programming language, R is not well suited to large-scale data manipulation or processing of large files (Adler [2010](#Adler2010): 157&ndash;158). Therefore it is generally recommended that data preprocessing be conducted using other programming languages. In linguistics, this is typically done with Python. However, since I am proficient in JavaScript and not Python, the scripts for this project are written in JavaScript (specifically Node.js, which can JavaScript on a local computer). JavaScript (via Node.js) is however gaining traction in data science, a trend which is expected to continue.

Node also comes with the Node Package Manager (<abbr title='Node package manager'>npm</abbr>), which allows you to install packages that other programmers have written in Node. Any public package in the npm registry may be installed by running `npm install {package-name}` from the command line.

For more information about Node.js and npm, visit the [Node.js][Node] and [npm][npm] websites.

You will need to download Node and npm in order to run many scripts in this project. You can download both pieces of software from the [Node.js web page][Node]. The scripts in this repository were written using Version 12 of Node, so you may need to download that specific version in order for the scripts in this project to work correctly.

Once Node is installed on your computer, any Node script can be run from the command line with the command `node {filename}`.

NPM also allows you to save commonly-used command line commands as project-specific scripts, saving you from having to retype the command and all its arguments each time you want to run it. You can run any of the npm scripts in this repository from the command line following the format `npm run {script-name}`.

### Installing the Project

Once you have cloned this repository and installed npm and Node, install the necessary packages for this project by navigating to the root folder of the repository in the command line and running `npm install`.

## 3. Data Collection

As mentioned above, all the data in this study are publicly available. This section presents the necessary steps for obtaining that data. Note that this repository does not contain the primary data itself, just annotations, statistics, and other derived versions of that data. The primary data itself lives in various places online, described below.

The data used for the investigation of English come from the [Open American National Corpus][OANC] (<abbr title='Open American National Corpus'>OANC</abbr>), a 15 million word corpus whose data are entirely open access. Since the data from other languages in this study are all from spoken texts, I elected to use just the spoken portion of the OANC, totaling 3,217,772 tokens. This spoken portion of the OANC is actually composed of two distinct subcorporaâ€”the [Charlotte Narrative & Conversation Collection][Charlotte] (<abbr title='Charlotte Narrative &amp; Conversation Collection'>CNCC</abbr> or simply "the Charlotte corpus") and the [Switchboard Corpus][Switchboard]. More details about the Charlotte corpus may be found [here][Charlotte], and the Switchboard corpus [here][Switchboard].

The OANC may be downloaded in its entirety from from the [OANC download page][OANC-download] in `.zip` (625MB) or `.tgz` formats. You will need to unzip the folder after you have downloaded it. The spoken portion of the corpus is in `data/spoken` inside the downloaded folder.

## 4. Data Preparation

This section covers the steps necessary to convert and otherwise prepare the data used in this study for annotation and analysis.

When scripting with JavaScript, I find it significantly easier to work with data in <abbr title='JavaScript Object Notation'>JSON</abbr> (JavaScript Object Notation) format rather than raw text files. JSON is a simple text format that is highly human-readable, and can be natively parsed by every major programming language. As such it has become the standard data interchange format for the modern web. More information about JSON format can be found [here][JSON]. More details about the use of JSON format for linguistic data can be found [here][Daffodil].

### English

This section covers the steps for converting the OANC data to JSON format.

#### Tokenizing the OANC

For the OANC, converting the data to JSON involved first tokenizing the corpus. The OANC project provides an [ANC Tool][ANC-Tool] for this purpose, which offers various ways of converting and tagging OANC data. More information about the ANC Tool may be found [here][ANC-Tool]. Steps for tokenizing the OANC using the ANC Tool are as follows:

1. Download the ANC Tool from the [ANC Tool download page][ANC-Tool] and unzip the folder. If you have already cloned this repository, you may skip this step; the ANC Tool is located in the `scripts/ANC` folder.

1. If you do not have Java installed on your computer, download it from [here][Java] and then install it on your computer.

1. Run the ANC Tool following the instructions on the [ANC Tool page][ANC-Tool]. It is recommended that you run the tool from the command line following the format `java -Xmx500M -jar ANCTool-x.y.z-jar.jar`. See the [ANC Tool page][ANC-Tool] for complete details. If you have npm installed on your computer, you can simply run the ANC Tool from the command line with `npm run anc`.

1. The first time you run the ANC Tool, it will ask you to specify the location of the folder where the files `annotations.xml` and `OANC-corpus-header.xml` are located. Select this folder and click _Accept_.

1. A screen with various settings will appear. Select the following:

    - **Input Directory:** Select the folder containing the data you wish to tokenize.
    - **Output Directory:** Select the location where you would like the new version of the corpus to be generated. Make sure this folder is **different** from the input directory.
    - **Input Format:** Select _GrAF_.
    - **Encoding (Text):** Select _UTF-8_.
    - **Copy Directory Structure:** Check this box. (However, leaving it uncheck should not affect the scripts in this project.)
    - **MonoConc Pro**: Select this tab.
    - **Part of Speech:** Select _Hepple part of speech tags_
    - **Separator Character:** Leave this set to the underscore (`_`)

1. Click the _Process_ button. This will begin converting the corpus, which will take several minutes. This converts each text in the OANC to a new file that is tokenized and tagged for part of speech.

#### Converting the OANC to JSON

To convert the OANC to JSON, I used a JavaScript library called [`tags2dlx`][tags2dlx], which I wrote and published for this purpose. It takes a directory of texts tagged for part of speech (where each word token is followed by an underscore and then its part-of-speech tag) and converts it to a JSON file. More information about the `tags2dlx` library may be found [here][tags2dlx].

To convert the OANC, follow the instructions for using the `tags2dlx` library, which can be found [here][tags2dlx]. In this repository, the converted files are located in `data/English/data`, and end in a `.json` extension.

<!-- For ease of analysis, I chose to format all the corpora used in this study as [Scription][Scription] files, a simple, very readable text format, which places one interlinear glossed utterance on each line. (For the English data, this simply amounts to placing one utterance / sentence on each line, with no accompanying translation or glosses.) Read more about the Scription format [here][Scription]. -->

## 5. Data Annotation

The annotations on the data are <dfn>stand-off</dfn> or <dfn>standalone</dfn> annotationsâ€”that is, annotations which live in a separate file, and contain information about the original utterances they apply to. For this project, I stored the annotations in basic tab-separated files (`.tsv`), making it easy to add and edit annotations using spreadsheet software such as [Microsoft Excel][Excel] or [Apache OpenOffice Calc][OpenOffice], among others. All annotations were placed in a single large spreadsheet, with the language of each annotation / observation indicated.

The columns included in the annotation spreadsheet are below.

Column Name   | Description
------------- | -----------
language      | The ISO 639-3 code for the language of this observation.
token         | A transcription of the word token being annotated. This may also be called the <dfn>wordform</dfn>. It does not include any prosodic markup or punctuation.
lexeme        | The headword representing the lexeme that this word token belongs to. For homonymous lexemes, a trailing number is sometimes added (for example, `house1`, `house2`).
archlexeme    | The archlexeme that this word token and lexeme belongs to.
function      | The discourse function of this word token. This must have a value of `R` (reference), `P`, (predication), or `M` (modification).
transcription | A transcription of the utterance that the word token appears in, without prosodic markup or punctuation.
translation   | A translation of the utterance that the word token appears in. This was not included for English data.
text          | The name of the text that the token appears in.
utterance     | The number of the utterance within the text that the token appears in. (Numbering starts at 1.)
