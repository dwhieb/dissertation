In short, Bach revises the machinery of the transformational grammar of his day so that the deep structure of sentences more closely resembles the logical systems used in philosophical logician by philosophers such as Rudolph Carnap. Bach notes:

{\textgreater} In particular, such systems do not have any subdivision of 'lexical items' into nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Much more basic is the distinction between variables, names, and general 'predicates' which can be {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-placed with respect to the number of terms that can occur as their arguments. (p. 121)

This work is notable for being the first (as far as I am away) to use the term {\textless}dfn{\textgreater}contentives{\textless}/dfn{\textgreater} to refer to a category that subsumes the traditional major lexical categories of noun, verb, and adjective. Although Bach is not cited as a source, Bach's usage of the term {\textless}dfn{\textgreater}contentives{\textless}/dfn{\textgreater} in this manner was apparently adopted by Kees Hengeveld ([2004]({\#}Hengeveldetal2004)) in his approach to flexible categories.},

annote = {This article appeared in the second issue of Linguistic Typology, at a time when lexical categories was receiving a good deal of attention in the typological literature (Frans Plank's bibliography of word classes having been just published in the first issue of the same journal). As such, this article is influential in the literature on lexical flexibility, and the term "Broschartian language" is still used when discussing the possible ways to analyze cases of lexical flexibility.

Broschart argues that there are three possible ways to analyze the seeming lack of a noun-verb distinction in Tongan: 1) the conversion hypothesis argues that the lexical categories of noun and verb are distinct, but simply unmarked, so that all cases of lexical flexibility are simply conversion; 2) the nominal vs. verbal syntax hypothesis states that lexical categories are not lexically specified, but instead are syntactic slots; and 3) the structural alternative hypothesis argues that Tongan does not possess the categories noun and verb, on either the lexical or syntactic levels, and that another distinction is relevant instead.

Broschart adopts the third approach, and argues that Tongan is a type/token language, i.e. a language in which all lexical items are "predicates" as the term is meant in predicate logic. Any lexeme in the language may be used to predicate, and what the grammar of the language encodes is instead a distinction between whether a lexical item is being used to predicate or to indicate a term which is being predicated over. Broschart's approach thus mirrors that of Bach (1968), who argued for the same distinction but at the level of deep structure in early formulations of generative grammar. In some ways this approach is also similar to calling Tongan an omnipredicative language. Though well-known and widely discussed, I know of no other researchers who have adopted a Broschartian analysis of languages purported to exhibit lexical flexibility.},

While Gil claims that lexical items "have no typical or unmarked ontological category" (p. 190), he also notes that single-word expressions most typically have a default interpretation, even though other interpretations are sometimes available. Under a prototype-based approach to word meaning, it is expected that certain senses of a word are more central, and less semantically marked, than others. Based on cognitive research on prototypes, it would therefore be surprising if Gil's extreme claim - that lexical items do not have a default ontological type / category - were true.

It comprises two sections: discourse or 'ungoverned' anaphora/cataphora and syntactic or 'governed' anaphora/cataphora. The running theme of the book is to show that zeros signal maximum referential continuity, and that this principle helps explain the distribution of zero reference crosslinguistically. Giv{\'{o}}n explains the use of zero for referential continuity via two cognitive principles: informational predictability (anaphoric), wherein predictable information need not be mentioned, and informational importance (cataphoric), wherein unimportant information need not be mentioned.

The book spends little time discussing lexical categories, but does note one highly relevant connection for the study of discourse and lexical flexibility:

{\textgreater} The overwhelming tendency in natural human discourse is to make perceptually salient, compact and temporally-stable entities – most commonly nouns – the old-information chunks that ground new information. As a result, natural human discourse seems to be ‘about' such nominal entities, which are then coded by various grammatical means as the topical referents in the discourse, most typically the grammatical subjects and objects of clauses. (Giv{\'{o}}n 2017: 32)

A prediction that would seem to stem from this is that (back)grounding information is more likely to be coded using referring constructions than predicative constructions.

Giv{\'{o}}n also notes that nominalization is a common diachronic pathway into subordination (with the exception of adverbial clauses), motivated by the fact that the nominalized referent is functioning as an argument of the clause. This raises the question whether, in highly flexible languages, we should similarly expect to see lexical items used as arguments coded with referential rather than predicative constructions.},

abstract = {Most linguists who have investigated linguistic categories from a universal viewpoint have accepted the existence of two basic parts of speech, *noun* and *verb*. Other categories are found to be only inconsistently represented; thus *adjective* is manifested in many languages as a class of stative verb. Furthermore, individual languages often have intermediate categories such as *gerund*, which cannot be unambiguously assigned to a single category. We suggest here that the basic categories N and V are to be viewed as universal lexicalizations of the prototypical discourse functions of 'discourse-manipulable participant' and 'reported event', respectively. We find that the grammars of languages tend to label the categories N and V with morphosyntactic markers which are iconically characteristic of these categories to the degree that a given instance of N or V approaches its prototypical function. In other words, the closer a form is to signaling this prime function, the more the language tends to recognize its function through morphemes typical of the category—e.g. deictic markers for N, tense markers for V. We conclude by suggesting that categoriality itself is another fundamental property of grammars which may be directly derived from discourse function.},
annote = {Hopper {\&} Thompson argue that categoriality is not a property of linguistic forms per se, but rather a matter of their function in discourse. Linguistic forms are said to be acategorial, although Hopper {\&} Thompson acknowledge that most forms, as a result of their semantic affordances, have a propensity for one category or another. They define prototypical nouns as items which are discourse manipulable, and prototypical verbs as items which are construed as reported events. They provide empirical data showing that, when an item is not functioning to introduce a new participant into the discourse or to report an event (e.g. a continuing topic or a complement clause) it is less strongly marked as a member of the category noun or verb. Conversely, items which perform these functions are more likely to be explicitly marked with morphology relating to that function. They also posit an implicational universal wherein languages require derivational morphology to derive a noun from a verbal root, but can derive verbs productively from either nominal or verbal roots with no overt morphology. In other words, all languages are omnipredicative but do not necessarily show bidirectionality between nouns and verbs (to borrow terminology from Evans {\&} Osada ([2005]({\#}EvansOsada2005))).

This influential article was one of the first studies to prominently take a discourse-based approach to lexical categories, and served as a foundation for many other studies in functionalist linguistics, including especially work by William Croft. Croft's typological-markedness approach echoes that of Hopper {\&} Thompson in that it sees categoriality as prototypal rather than a property of specific lexical items which divide neatly into distinct categories. If Hopper {\&} Thompson's thesis is correct, it would seem to make two predictions: 1) In rigid languages (i.e. languages with more clearly delineated parts of speech), category-specific morphology should arise from the use of lexical items in discourse to either introduce a discourse-manipulable participant or report an event; 2) In flexible languages, the choice of category for a flexible wordform is dependent on its discourse function.},

Jacobsen takes particular issue with the second claim, which he notes is the more substantive of the two. He provides evidence in these languages for a syntactic difference between argument and predicate, and shows that flexibility between noun and verb is often unidirectional: verbs may only appear as arguments in their nominalized form. However, Jacobsen also allows for instances of multiple class membership and lexicalization, and it is not clear how this concession affects his position.

This article is especially useful for its thorough survey of the literature on this topic, and similarly thorough treatment of data from the relevant languages.

Items with various combinations of valued and unvalued (or incomplete) phi-features therefore exhibit a mix of properties.

abstract = {The possibility of polycategorial lexical items, unspecified for category, raises interesting issues. One is the predictability of semantic relationships between polycategorial forms in predicating and referring uses. Another is the language- internal generality of the phenomenon, whether it necessarily holds of all units at a particular level. A third is its cross-linguistic generality and potential association with certain typological features. These issues are examined with examples from a language exhibiting striking similarities to the Mayan languages for which polycategoriality has recently been argued. Central Alaskan Yup'ik Eskimo appears to show robust polycategoriality at the root, stem, word, and clause level. A closer look indicates that the story is actually more interesting, and that the universality of polycategoriality remains an open question.},

annote = {Mithun presents numerous potential cases of lexical flexibility at the root, stem, and fully-inflected word levels in Central Alaskan Yup'ik (Eskimo-Aleut {\textgreater} Eskimo {\textgreater} Yupik, Alaska), and argues that these items are specified for lexical category in each case, and therefore should not be considered flexible. As a diagnostic for identifying lexical flexibility, Mithun notes that zero-derivation presupposes a basic/derived relationship, even if diachronically, whereas polycategoriality assumes a single abstract meaning. In the case of polycategoriality, more specific meanings in different constructions must be accounted for.

Mithun presents the following arguments in favor of zero-derivation for seemingly flexible forms in Yup'ik:

* Most roots are only used as nouns or verbs. 35{\%} are nominal, 53{\%} are verbal, and only 12{\%} may be used as both.

* There are no semantic commonalities to which roots may be used for which function. The possible uses of a root must be memorized on a lexeme-specific basis.

* The semantic relationships between roots being used for different functions are not predictable, suggesting that the items in each pair constitute separate lexical items.

* The same kinds of semantic relationships hold between homophonous roots as appear in derived stems. Some roots can alternate classes with no derivation, while others cannot. This suggests that homophonous roots are actually the result of zero-derivation.

* Yup'ik derivational affixes are fully specified for both the lexical catgory they attach to and the lexical category that results. If two meanings are possible for a root, a derivational affix will utilize the meaning most prototypical to the category it selects for.

* Despite homophony between nominal and verbal uses of fully-inflected words, the two categories have different syntactic distributions.

* The homophony between nominal and verbal fully-inflected words is the result of insubordination and other diachronic processes.},

@book{Nakayama2002,

annote = {This volume is a grammatical sketch of the Nuuchahnulth (a.k.a. Nootka; Wakashan, British Columbia) language. It is a revised version of Nakayama's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of California, Santa Barbara, covering phonology, morphology, word classes / word formation, and syntax / argument structure, with a strong focus on discourse throughout. The sketch is based on natural discourse data collected during Nakayama's fieldwork.

Nuuchahnulth and other Wakashan languages have featured prominently in the literature on lexical flexibility, primarily due to claims by Sapir and Swadesh ([Sapir {\&} Swadesh 1939]({\#}SapirSwadesh1939); [Swadesh 1939]({\#}Swadesh1939)) that the language lacks lexical categories. Jacobsen ([1979]({\#}Jacobsen1979)) later took an opposing view, stating that lexical items in Nuuchahnulth are specified for lexical category. In this grammar sketch, Nakayama adopts a functional approach informed by diachrony, and argues that, while lexical categories do exist in Nuuchahnulth, they are not strongly grammaticized, and there is a low degree of specialization for lexical items. Instead, he states that lexical categories in Nuuchahnulth are a matter of repeated discourse tendencies rather than a set of structural properties.

Nakayama's approach to lexical flexibility shows similarities to Hopper {\&} Thompson's ([1984]({\#}HopperThompson1984)) approach to lexical categories more generally in claiming that lexical categories in Nuuchahnulth are imposed via discourse rather than lexically-specified. Nakayama's idea that parts of speech in Nuuchahnulth are "less strongly grammaticized" than other languages also has an interesting implication for the historical development of lexical categories: it suggests that lexical specification for parts of speech may emerge from repeated discourse tendencies that become routinized over time, so that a given lexical item become solely or at least strongly associated with a particular pragmatic function, and the set of constructions which encode that function.},

@phdthesis{Swadesh1933,
abstract = {In Nootka, it is necessary to distinguish the word as a lexical unit from the word as a syntactic unit. The lexical word is a close-knit phonetic and semantic unit built out of a stem and any number of formative suffixes. As used in the sentence, the word may have the form of the basic lexical unit or may consist of the latter with the addition of any number of incremental suffixes which are phonetically and, to a certain extent, semantically distinguishable from formative suffixes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIncremental suffixes have the function of rounding out the word into a predication or otherwise preparing it for its function in the sentence; they express ideas of time, voice, mode, and person. Formative suffixes have the function of building up the lexical or unextended word on the basis of the stem; they include aspect formatives and derivational suffixes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFormal word types (parts of speech) in Nootka are two: particles and normal words. Particles include syntactic, imperative, and interjectional elements; they are characterized by a simple structure, a lack of aspect implication, and a limited capacity for extension by means of incremental suffixes. Normal words are all verbal in fundamental nature; they are formally characterized by a potentially polysynthetic structure, a definite aspect implication, and unlimited capacity for extension by means of incremental suffixes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe unextended word is semantically a potential predication concerning the potential subject of the word. (The term "subject of the word" is justified in Nootka because subject pronouns in the form of incremental suffixes are attachable to any normal word.) Some words constitute a unified potential predication, others a compound potential predication, depending on the type of derivational suffix employed in the construction of the word. Thus, ther is one type of suffix that always makes the word into a unified potential predication; suffixes of this type may be called governing suffixes. Another type of suffix sets a secondary potential predication alongside the original one and builds thus a compound potential predication; suffixes of this type may be called restrictive suffixes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe units in derivation are the underlying theme and the derivational suffix and the meaning of the derived form is a function of the meaning of these two units. To understand the semantics of derivation in Nootka, it is necessary to classify underlying themes and derivational suffixes according to semantic content. To this purpose, the following semantic classes are proposed: substantive (e.g., "to be a house"), state (e.g., "to be erect"), action (e.g., "to jump"), location (e.g., "to be in the houes"), time (e.g., "to be at night"), quantity (e.g., "to be three"), specification (e.g., "to be this one"). It is important to note that these are semantic and not formal classes; for, aside from particles, there is only one formal class, essentially verbal. The classification holds for derivational suffixes as well as themes except that the distinction bewteen governing and restrictive derivational suffixes is of even more fundamental importance. In addition to themes belonging to one or another of these classes, there are restricted themes (built up by means of restrictive suffixes and expressing compound potential predications) belonging to two or more semantic classes at once.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe derivational economy of Nootka tends on the whole to be mechanical in nature, but two interfering processes need to be recognized: implicit derivation and specialization. By implicit derivation, a theme takes on the meaning of a derivative of that theme (e.g., "knife in the hand" is used for "having a knife in the hand"). By specialization, a theme that should have a general reference is used to refer to something more particular (e.g., "big creature" is the regular expression for "whale"). While specialization and some instances of implicit derivation are sporadic and unpredictable, there are certain types of implicit derivation that are actually or almost regular.},
annote = {Swadesh's Ph.D. dissertation at Yale under Edward Sapir, this work provides a description of word structure and lexical semantics in Nuuchahnulth (a.k.a. Nootka; Wakashan {\textgreater} Southern Wakashan, British Colombia). Swadesh famously makes the claim that “Normal words [in Nuuchahnulth] are all verbal in fundamental nature” (p. iv), and that they are all of one type (i.e. a single lexical category). However, Swadesh also notes various selectional restrictions for certain affixes which partition the lexicon, such as a strict separation between suffixes which may attach to numeral stems vs. non-numeral stems (p. 112), or that certain suffixes require a “substantive” stem (p. 113). As such, Swadesh's categorization of the lexicon is based on semantic meaning, and comprises the following: substantive (entity), state, action, location, time, quantity, and specification (indication). Swadesh partitions the lexicon in this way on the basis of the existence of a set of seven “special reference stems” which express these categories, and assumes that these stems represent a fundamental set of categories in the lexicon, despite there being no formal evidence elsewhere in the language. (Here, Swadesh anticipates what Levinson {\&} Burenhult (2009) refer to as a semplate, or a semantic template that operates in more than one area of the grammar.) Swadesh also discusses various idiosyncrasies in the lexicon, in particular *implicit derivation* and *specialization*. In implicit derivation, a derived stem takes on a meaning that is more than the sum of its parts, e.g. a derived form that literally means ‘knife in hand' is in actual practice used to mean ‘having a knife in hand' (p. iv; pp. 43ff.). Some of these cases fall into classes of regular patterns, and others are idiosyncratic. By specialization, Swadesh refers to the use of a derived stem to refer to something more specific than the meaning of its parts implies, e.g. the use of a form literally meaning ‘big creature' to mean ‘whale' (p. 54). Like implicit derivation, some cases of specialization follow certain general patterns, while others are idiosyncratic.},

annote = {The central aim of this book is to show that linguistic categories are prototypal, i.e. exhibiting the properties of prototype-based categories. By this he means that categories a) often lack clear boundaries, b) have an internal structure wherein some members of the category are better representatives of the category than others, and c) the members of a category often show a family resemblance structure, i.e. they are a radial category. Taylor shows how prototype theory applies to linguistic categorization in three domains: 1) the categorization of experience (applying linguistic labels to our experience of the world); 2) the categorization of linguistic experience (abstracting linguistic types and schemas from individual tokens); and 3) the categorization of linguistic concepts (technical concepts and terminology in the field of linguistics). Taylor shows that all of these exhibit the behavior expected of prototype categories.

This book was central in introducing linguists to the prototype theory of Rosch and Lakoff, and making these concepts more broadly accessible to the field. The book explicitly discusses several issues of central relevance for lexical flexibility, including polysemy and compositionality. Regarding lexical categories, Taylor notes that they exhibit a prototype structure as well, with some members of, for example, the category Noun being better members of the category than others. Taylor also questions the utility of the distinction between polysemy and homonymy; a more useful framework is to consider the various meanings of a form as having a family resemblance structure (meaning chains), wherein some meanings are more closely linked or related than others. This approach would also seem to be applicable to lexical flexibility: rather than viewing zero-derivation / conversion as a case of homonymy (or polysemy), it may be more useful to view those particular meanings of a form that have crossed the traditional part-of-speech boundary as simply non-central members of the lexeme's meaning.},

annote = {In a well-known paper, Hopper {\&} Thompson ([1984]({\#}HopperThompson1984)) argue that the lexical categories noun and verb are not lexically-specified but rather imposed by discourse. In the present paper, Thompson builds on this work to provide a discourse-based explanation for the fact that property concepts crosslinguistically sometimes pattern like verbs, and other times like nouns, and in other languages constitute their own class (with combinations of these attested for individual languages as well). Why are property concepts distributed across different classes, rather than forming their own class in every language? Thompson answers this question by examining the use of property concepts in natural discourse data from English (which is generally thought to have a distinct adjective class) and Mandarin (in which property concepts largely pattern like verbs). Thompson finds that property concepts generally perform two functions in discourse: to predicate a property of an already-introduced referent, in which case the property concept appears in a predicative adjective construction; or to introduce a new referent into the discourse, in which case the property concept appears as an attributive (modifying) adjective with a (relatively) semantically vacuous nominal head, such as, for example, it's a religious thing. In the latter case, the attributive use is used to introduce a new referent with the particular defining property indicated by the adjective. This functional division is what explains the crosslinguistic distribution of property concepts across both nominal and verbal categories, with some languages exhibiting a distinct adjective category since property concepts are neither prototypical nouns nor verbs.},
