 		so_RB what_WP well_RB what_WP do_VBP you_PRP think_VBP
 	
 	
 		well_RB
 		providing_VBG universal_JJ health_NN care_NN insurance_NN for_IN the_DT whole_JJ country_NN is_VBZ a_DT pretty_RB big_JJ task_NN and_CC i_NNP uh_UH personally_RB i_NNP do_VBP n't_RB approve_VB of_IN it_PRP for_IN two_CD reasons_NNS number_NN one_CD
 		is_VBZ that_IN i_NNP think_VBP that_IN uh_UH the_DT federal_JJ government_NN
 		has_VBZ a_DT problem_NN with_IN the_DT deficit_NN right_RB now_RB and_CC if_IN they_PRP were_VBD to_TO administer_VB this_DT they_PRP would_MD uh_UH get_VB us_PRP more_JJR and_CC more_JJR into_IN debt_NN
 		further_RBR than_IN we_PRP can_MD ever_RB get_VB out_IN ourselves_PRP number_NN two_CD i_NNP think_VBP that_IN the_DT quality_NN of_IN health_NN care_NN would_MD go_VB down_RB because_IN the_DT competition_NN would_MD
 		would_MD be_VB dried_VBN up_RB and_CC really_RB no_DT one_PRP would_MD be_VB would_MD only_RB answer_VB to_TO to_TO the_DT government_NN to_TO a_DT big_JJ bureaucratic_JJ bureaucratic_JJ mess_NN
 		and_CC uh_UH i_NNP 've_VBP seen_VBN what_WP it_PRP has_VBZ done_VBN in_IN other_JJ countries_NNS and_CC so_RB i_NNP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB uh_UH
 		i_NNP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB we_PRP should_MD head_VB in_IN that_DT direction_NN although_IN that_IN we_PRP have_VBP problems_NNS right_RB now_RB and_CC i_NNP do_VBP agree_VBP that_IN they_PRP exist_VBP because_IN health_NN care_NN insurance_NN for_IN for_IN everyone_NN
 		is_VBZ skyrocketing_VBG and_CC it_PRP 's_VBZ become_VB to_TO a_DT point_NN where_WRB basically_RB no_DT one_PRP can_MD afford_VB it_PRP anymore_RB
 	
 	
 		um-hum_JJ
 	
 	
 		how_WRB do_VBP you_PRP feel_VBP about_IN the_DT whole_JJ whole_JJ ordeal_NN
 	
 	
 		well_RB i_NNP agree_VBP that_IN it_PRP 's_VBZ a_DT big_JJ task_NN but_CC i_NNP think_VBP that_IN i_NNP think_VBP that_IN the_DT US_NNP should_MD move_VB towards_IN some_DT kind_NN of_IN national_JJ health_NN care_NN plan_NN
 		at_IN least_JJS as_IN a_DT long_JJ term_NN kind_NN of_IN goal_NN
 	
 	
 		um-hum_JJ
 	
 	
 		you_PRP know_VBP possibly_RB
 		you_PRP know_VBP just_RB starting_VBG with_IN more_JJR regulation_NN of_IN health_NN insurance_NN and_CC that_DT sort_NN of_IN thing_NN but_CC i_NNP think_VBP that_IN ultimately_RB it_PRP would_MD be_VB
 		a_DT good_JJ idea_NN to_TO
 		um_NN and_CC not_RB have_VB a_DT completely_RB socialized_JJ
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		medical_JJ system_NN in_IN the_DT country_NN but_CC maybe_RB something_NN about_IN halfway_RB between_IN that_DT and_CC what_WP we_PRP have_VBP now_RB
 	
 	
 		uh-huh_JJ
 		okay_JJ
 	
 	
 		it_PRP um_NN just_RB because_IN it_PRP seems_VBZ that_DT
 		um_NN health_NN insurance_NN costs_NNS are_VBP sky_NN rocketing_VBG well_RB as_RB fast_RB as_IN the_DT national_JJ deficit_NN
 	
 	
 		oh_UH yes_UH
 	
 	
 		perhaps_RB and_CC so_IN that_DT 's_VBZ
 		and_CC that_DT 's_VBZ a_DT that_DT 's_VBZ a_DT vicious_JJ cycle_NN of_IN course_NN
 	
 	
 		but_CC what_WP what_WP you_PRP 're_VBP think_VBP
 		yeah_NN so_RB what_WP you_PRP 're_VBP saying_VBG though_IN is_VBZ instead_RB of_IN having_VBG the_DT national_JJ government_NN government_NN administer_VB
 	
 	
 		because_IN
 	
 	
 		giving_VBG health_NN insurance_NN to_TO every_DT man_NN woman_NN and_CC child_NN with_IN throughout_IN the_DT whole_JJ company_NN you_PRP see_VBP more_JJR of_IN them_PRP as_IN regulating_VBG the_DT high_JJ costs_NNS
 		uh_UH that_IN people_NNS are_VBP forced_VBN to_TO pay_VB for_IN it_PRP right_RB now_RB
 		is_VBZ that_WDT is_VBZ that_IN correct_JJ or_CC do_VBP you_PRP think_VBP that_DT
 	
 	
 		um_NN
 		well_RB
 		i_NNP um_NN
 		well_RB i_NNP would_MD n't_RB exclude_VB the_DT possibility_NN of_IN the_DT government_NN actually_RB administrating_VBG it_PRP ultimately_RB i_NNP do_VBP n't_RB think_VB that_IN that_DT would_MD necessarily_RB be_VB such_PDT a_DT bad_JJ idea_NN
 		and_CC
 		um_NN
 	
 	
 		well_RB with_IN the_DT with_IN the_DT costs_NNS as_IN they_PRP are_VBP right_RB now_RB do_VBP you_PRP think_VBP that_IN the_DT government_NN uh_UH because_IN what_WP that_WDT would_MD require_VB is_VBZ for_IN us_PRP to_TO pay_VB uh_UH more_JJR taxes_NNS and_CC the_DT
 		the_DT income_NN the_DT people_NNS that_WDT can_MD afford_VB taxes_NNS the_DT middle_JJ income_NN and_CC the_DT upper_JJ income_NN will_MD be_VB paying_VBG more_JJR cash_NN taxes_NNS to_TO to_TO pay_VB for_IN health_NN insurance_NN for_IN everyone_NN whereas_IN right_RB now_RB the_DT the_DT public_JJ themselves_PRP
 	
 	
 		right_NN
 	
 	
 		get_VB health_NN insurance_NN and_CC they_PRP provide_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ health_NN insurance_NN
 	
 	
 		the_DT well_NN as_IN it_PRP is_VBZ now_RB the_DT middle_JJ and_CC upper_JJ classes_NNS are_VBP paying_VBG more_JJR than_IN their_PRP$ share_NN for_IN the_DT health_NN care_NN of_IN the_DT whole_JJ country_NN because_IN they_PRP 're_VBP the_DT only_JJ people_NNS that_WDT can_MD afford_VB health_NN insurance_NN
 		and_CC so_IN that_IN the_DT other_JJ people_NNS have_VBP no_DT health_NN insurance_NN and_CC you_PRP know_VBP they_PRP 'll_MD get_VB medical_JJ care_NN anyway_RB at_IN least_JJS in_IN emergencies_NNS
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and_CC somebody_NN winds_NNS up_RP paying_VBG for_IN that_DT and_CC
 		basically_RB the_DT people_NNS paying_VBG for_IN it_PRP are_VBP the_DT people_NNS who_WP are_VBP buying_VBG health_NN insurance_NN
 		so_RB i_NNP do_VBP not_RB see_VB that_DT anything_NN
 		this_DT situation_NN would_MD get_VB any_DT worse_JJR that_DT way_NN it_PRP might_MD get_VB better_JJR
 	
 	
 		you_PRP think_VBP it_PRP might_MD be_VB get_VB better_JJR huh_NN i_NNP i_NNP kind_NN of_IN disagree_VBP  the_DT reason_NN being_VBG is_VBZ uh_UH
 	
 	
 		um-hum_JJ
 	
 	
 		we_PRP have_VBP i_NNP do_VBP n't_RB know_VB i_NNP guess_VBP it_PRP 's_VBZ my_PRP$ my_PRP$ fear_NN of_IN the_DT national_JJ government_NN and_CC also_RB because_IN the_DT bureaucratic_JJ
 	
 	
 		um-hum_JJ
 	
 	
 		rules_NNS that_IN it_PRP would_MD take_VB to_TO administer_VB it_PRP and_CC um_NN
 		the_DT the_DT health_NN insurance_NN companies_NNS right_RB now_RB pretty_RB much_JJ regulate_VB and_CC are_VBP pretty_RB picky_JJ and_CC and_CC uh_UH do_VBP n't_RB allow_VB
 		cases_NNS where_WRB they_PRP might_MD throw_VB them_PRP out_IN of_IN business_NN whereas_IN the_DT federal_JJ government_NN if_IN they_PRP took_VBD over_IN everything_NN they_PRP would_MD n't_RB care_VB because_IN they_PRP 'll_MD never_RB go_VB out_IN of_IN business_NN people_NNS would_MD still_RB have_VB to_TO pay_VB taxes_NNS the_DT money_NN would_MD have_VB to_TO come_VB from_IN somewhere_RB
 		and_CC so_IN you_PRP 'd_MD see_VB i_NNP i_NNP feel_VBP that_IN the_DT cost_NN would_MD increase_VB
 		dramatically_RB also_RB but_CC in_IN the_DT same_JJ sense_NN the_DT the_DT care_NN and_CC the_DT the_DT attitude_NN of_IN the_DT doctors_NNS and_CC the_DT professionals_NNS within_IN the_DT medical_JJ uh_UH field_NN
 		would_MD would_MD diminish_VB
 	
 	
 		um-hum_JJ
 	
 	
 		um_NN i_NNP
 	
 	
 		yeah_NN well_RB i_NNP think_VBP
