homeowners fleeced by lenders and the like. But due to the federal
budget cuts of the past 25 years, the office was forced to turn
away many thousands more.
Georgia is a lot like the rest of the country. Huge percentages
of the population are priced out of the legal system.
So Barnes' remarkable decision swims against the tide on two
fronts. First, as one astonished consultant put it, "it's
refreshing to see someone leave political office and not cash in."
And, second, as a leader of the legal community, Barnes seems to
have decided that an unfulfilled rhetorical pledge to legal
equality isn't enough.
For generations, we have we have declared, as a cornerstone of
constitutional government, that "there can be no equal justice
where the kind of trial a person gets depends on the amount of
money he has." But study after study shows that about 80 percent of
the legal needs of the poor in the United States are unmet. The
figure is almost as bleak for middle -income Americans.
Yet, unlike many industrial nations, we've recognized no general
right to representation in civil cases. Less than 1 percent of our
total expenditure for lawyers goes to service for the poor. Most
lawyers do no pro bono work at all. Recent affluence has eroded
rather than expanded support for such programs. Over the past
decade, the average revenue of the country's most successful firms
increased by over 50 percent, and their pro bono work dropped by a
third. We carve "equal justice under law" on our courthouse walls.
But that's about as far as the sentiment goes.
It is true, I'll concede, that Roy Barnes has only committed
half a year to the Georgia legal services program, not the rest of
his life. And he is already a wealthy man, so it's not exactly the
same thing as a young lawyer going to work for exceedingly modest
wages.
But one of the perplexing rituals of American politics is
listening to candidate after candidate explain that he runs for
office because he is driven to "represent the interests of ordinary
Americans." We accept these claims even though we know the
candidate has never spent a moment representing the powerless
before the campaign began, and that it would never even occur to
him to be bothered with such matters once the election is over.
Besides, even if it's just for six months, Barnes has made it
clear he'll roll up his sleeves and be a real Legal Aid lawyer.
He'll be trying cases, day after day. No staff. No prepared papers.
No scripted presentations. No assistants toting his bags. Just a
daunting caseload and beleaguered, frightened clients. Standing
shoulder to shoulder with those who have no one else to speak for
them. Carrying out the highest aspirations of both the legal
profession and the American democracy.
I love Jimmy Carter. I'm starting to feel the same way about Roy
Barnes.
