            To_TO justify_VB a_DT new_JJ increase_NN in_IN military_JJ pay_NN ,_, the_DT
Pentagon_NNP and_CC legislators_NNS are_VBP citing_VBG a_DT 13_CD percent_NN "_'' pay_VB gap_NN "_'' between_IN the_DT salaries_NNS
of_IN servicemen_NN and_CC their_PRP$ civilian_JJ counterparts_NNS ._. Ignoring_VBG for_IN a_DT moment_NN whether_IN a_DT
dramatic_JJ increase_NN in_IN military_JJ pay_NN is_VBZ needed_VBN ,_, the_DT 13_CD percent_NN figure_NN is_VBZ bogus_JJ ._.
Even_RB though_IN the_DT Congressional_NNP Budget_NNP Office_NNP debunked_JJ the_DT statistic_NN in_IN March_NNP ,_,
several_JJ military_JJ representatives_NNS continue_VBP to_TO cite_VB it_PRP in_IN congressional_JJ
testimony_NN ._.

            The_DT 13_CD percent_NN "_'' pay_VB gap_NN "_'' represents_VBZ the_DT difference_NN
in_IN the_DT growth_NN of_IN military_JJ versus_CC civilian_JJ wages_NNS since_IN 1982_CD -_: -_: that_DT is_VBZ ,_,
civilian_JJ wages_NNS have_VBP grown_VBN 13_CD percent_NN faster_RBR ._. This_DT does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN
soldiers_NNS earn_VBP less_JJR than_IN civilians_NNS ,_, because_IN it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB take_VB into_IN account_NN the_DT
pay_NN differential_NN from_IN 1982_CD ._. If_IN my_PRP$ wages_NNS have_VBP increased_VBN by_IN 100_CD percent_NN during_IN
the_DT past_JJ five_CD years_NNS while_IN Bill_NNP Gates_NNP '_POS have_VBP increased_VBN by_IN nearly_RB 50_CD percent_NN ,_, this_DT

making_VBG more_JJR to_TO begin_VB with_IN ._.

            Moreover_RB ,_, even_RB as_IN a_DT
measure_NN of_IN relative_JJ wage_NN growth_NN ,_, the_DT 13_CD percent_NN figure_NN fails_VBZ ._. First_LS ,_, the_DT 1982_CD
starting_VBG point--as_JJ opposed_VBN to_TO some_DT other_JJ year--makes_JJ the_DT gap_NN look_NN especially_RB
big_JJ ,_, since_IN there_EX was_VBD a_DT substantial_JJ military_JJ pay_NN increase_NN in_IN 1981_CD ._. Even_RB worse_JJR ,_,
the_DT comparison_NN does_VBZ not_RB account_VB for_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN most_JJS members_NNS of_IN the_DT armed_VBN
forces_NNS are_VBP younger_JJR and_CC less_RBR educated_VBN than_IN civilian_JJ workers_NNS ._. This_DT is_VBZ important_JJ
because_IN in_IN recent_JJ years_NNS the_DT wages_NNS of_IN college-educated_JJ workers_NNS have_VBP grown_VBN much_JJ
faster_RBR than_IN the_DT wages_NNS of_IN high-school-educated_JJ workers_NNS ._. The_DT better_JJR comparison_NN

            So_RB forget_VB about_IN 13_CD percent_NN argument_NN ._. Is_VBZ there_EX any_DT pay_NN gap_NN ?_.
A_DT rough_JJ study_NN by_IN the_DT CBO_NNP found_VBD that_WDT enlisted_VBD service_NN members_NNS earned_VBD
