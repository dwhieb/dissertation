            For_IN most_JJS Americans_NNPS ,_, taxes_NNS
are_VBP their_PRP$ most_RBS visible_JJ and_CC least_JJS pleasant_JJ contact_NN with_IN the_DT federal_JJ government_NN ._.
Naturally_RB ,_, taxes_NNS are_VBP almost_RB always_RB near_IN the_DT top_NN of_IN the_DT national_JJ policy_NN agenda_NN ,_,
and_CC 1996_CD is_VBZ no_DT exception_NN ._. This_DT year_NN ,_, as_IN in_IN many_JJ recent_JJ years_NNS ,_, the_DT focus_NN is_VBZ
likely_JJ to_TO be_VB on_IN what_WP is_VBZ called_VBN the_DT "_'' supply-side_JJ "_'' aspect_NN of_IN tax_NN policy_NN ._. Can_MD tax_VB
reduction_NN speed_NN up_RP the_DT growth_NN of_IN the_DT nation_NN 's_POS output_NN and_CC the_DT incomes_NNS of_IN the_DT
population_NN by_IN increasing_VBG saving_VBG ,_, investment_NN ,_, work_NN ,_, education_NN ,_, enterprise_NN ,_,
research_NN ,_, and_CC other_JJ factors_NNS that_WDT determine_VBP our_PRP$ capacity_NN to_TO produce_VB ?_. When_WRB Bob_NNP
Dole_NNP is_VBZ urged_VBN to_TO put_VB economic_JJ growth_NN at_IN the_DT center_NN of_IN his_PRP$ election_NN campaign_NN ,_, it_PRP
is_VBZ mainly_RB the_DT promise_NN of_IN tax_NN reduction_NN to_TO achieve_VB such_JJ effects_NNS that_IN people_NNS have_VBP
in_IN mind_NN ._. There_EX are_VBP ,_, of_IN course_NN ,_, other_JJ considerations_NNS to_TO be_VB weighed_VBN in_IN decisions_NNS
about_IN tax_NN policy--fairness_JJ ,_, and_CC costs_NNS of_IN compliance_NN ,_, for_IN example--but_JJ the_DT
growth_NN question_NN dominates_VBZ current_JJ discussion_NN ,_, and_CC we_PRP shall_MD mainly_RB concentrate_VB
on_IN that_DT in_IN this_DT week_NN 's_POS panel_NN ._.

            Nothing_NN very_RB significant_JJ
can_MD be_VB said_VBN about_IN taxes_NNS in_IN general_JJ ,_, except_IN that_DT hardly_RB anyone_NN likes_VBZ them_PRP ._. The_DT
effects_NNS of_IN tax_NN reduction_NN on_IN economic_JJ growth_NN will_MD depend_VB on_IN whether_IN the_DT
reduction_NN is_VBZ an_DT across-the-board_JJ cut_NN of_IN income-tax_NN rates_NNS ,_, a_DT reduction_NN of_IN
corporate-tax_JJ rates_NNS ,_, a_DT reduction_NN of_IN the_DT tax_NN on_IN capital_NN gains_NNS ,_, a_DT reduction_NN of_IN
the_DT tax_NN on_IN saved_VBN income_NN ,_, or_CC one_CD of_IN a_DT long_JJ list_NN of_IN other_JJ possibilities_NNS ._.

            The_DT effects_NNS will_MD depend_VB
also_RB on_IN the_DT budgetary_JJ context_NN in_IN which_WDT the_DT tax_NN cuts_NNS are_VBP to_TO occur_VB ._. Would_MD the_DT
proposed_VBN cut_NN of_IN some_DT taxes_NNS be_VB accompanied_VBN by_IN increases_NNS of_IN other_JJ taxes_NNS ,_, and_CC if_IN
so_RB ,_, which_WDT ?_. For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT "_'' flat_JJ tax_NN "_'' that_IN some_DT people_NNS propose_VBP involves_VBZ both_DT a_DT
reduction_NN of_IN rates_NNS and_CC an_DT increase_NN in_IN the_DT income_NN subject_JJ to_TO tax_VB because_IN of_IN the_DT
elimination_NN of_IN various_JJ deductions_NNS ._. Would_MD a_DT proposed_VBN tax_NN cut_NN be_VB accompanied_VBN by_IN
expenditure_NN cuts_NNS ,_, and_CC if_IN so_RB ,_, which_WDT ?_. In_IN our_PRP$ discussion_NN ,_, we_PRP shall_MD try_VB to_TO examine_VB
the_DT growth_NN effects_NNS of_IN various_JJ possible_JJ tax_NN programs_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ possible_JJ budgetary_JJ
