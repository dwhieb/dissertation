WynnTammi	31	4	I mean I	knew	how to drive this tractor and I could n't believe
sw2010-ms98-a-trans	46	23	but i do n't i do n't think he really	knew	it was gonna be as big as it was i
sw2027-ms98-a-trans	23	33	a few people that work there and he should he	knew	who worked there he should have realized that we were
sw2017-ms98-a-trans	50	14	look cracked to you i mean that 's how you	knew	it was broken or
sw2017-ms98-a-trans	53	9	oh so that 's that 's how you	knew	well since like i say we 're first time homeowners
sw2017-ms98-a-trans	84	21	always lived in houses that he built and then they	knew	they were getting a good deal so
sw2036-ms98-a-trans	83	4	but actually i	knew	another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school
sw2044-ms98-a-trans	31	22	ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody	knew	how to drive in this weather
sw2065-ms98-a-trans	125	28	out to be kind of a joke the ones i	knew	you know always chose the Red Cross because they did
sw2079-ms98-a-trans	13	20	carpenter but in fact he 's in electronics but he	knew	the only way we 'd ever have a new home
sw2071-ms98-a-trans	65	3	and you	knew	it had had been through a whole lot
sw2096-ms98-a-trans	67	6	and and i just just	knew	i was being photographed you know i just i 'm
sw2107-ms98-a-trans	13	25	have thought a child had died i called everyone i	knew	i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching
sw2107-ms98-a-trans	13	31	i called everyone i knew i had every friend i	knew	in the apartment searching for this cat and they laughed
sw2136-ms98-a-trans	93	21	well then the second time when i got hired i	knew	what was coming you know so then they checked us
sw2139-ms98-a-trans	161	21	phone mail services or if GTE had purchased Tigon i	knew	there was some type of a tie in there i
sw2154-ms98-a-trans	45	6	two programs uh that i	knew	
sw2154-ms98-a-trans	48	3	and i	knew	that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
sw2145-ms98-a-trans	90	42	a two year old off in a home where you	knew	there were going to be four other kids and
sw2158-ms98-a-trans	42	3	yeah i	knew	you were n't the Tar Heels uh no somebody gave
sw2160-ms98-a-trans	29	4	oh if i	knew	that i 'd be a very wealthy person
sw2164-ms98-a-trans	82	33	or that they were uh of sound mind where they	knew	what crimes they were committing i mean people know what
sw2171-ms98-a-trans	67	13	do n't know either the other growing up all i	knew	was
sw2174-ms98-a-trans	28	45	have an ice storm coming up and then no one	knew	how bad it was going to be
sw2177-ms98-a-trans	71	28	been someone that had killed other people but no one	knew	that
sw2171-ms98-a-trans	99	11	i 'd probably have a different perspective if i actually	knew	someone that had gone into the Peace Corps
sw2173-ms98-a-trans	152	26	is wonderful and and they at least i kind of	knew	what was going on on the other side of the
sw2173-ms98-a-trans	157	4	i i never	knew	that i never even thought that they would have CNN
sw2187-ms98-a-trans	118	6	right that 's true i	knew	that yeah yeah
sw2195-ms98-a-trans	25	16	us to find her not guilty because even though they	knew	
sw2196-ms98-a-trans	29	39	were new to the this whole process and all we	knew	is that it was a the cheapest house that this
sw2313-ms98-a-trans	115	21	n't have to worry about carrying that much unless i	knew	i
sw2315-ms98-a-trans	85	3	yeah i	knew	a guy here had a a Nissan pickup truck and
sw2305-ms98-a-trans	131	34	i mean somebody could walk in the door and i	knew	exactly what they were going to do and say
sw2318-ms98-a-trans	21	6	i would you know i	knew	we had to go to war and i knew you
sw2318-ms98-a-trans	21	15	i knew we had to go to war and i	knew	you know it was the best thing but i did
sw2335-ms98-a-trans	21	12	you do it then that was it i mean i	knew	that i would get mean more trouble from my mother
sw2337-ms98-a-trans	47	28	n't afraid of the metric system and and and i	knew	how much it made sense and how much easier it
sw2333-ms98-a-trans	164	50	to see you he 's like you 're sort of	knew	why
sw2331-ms98-a-trans	116	19	back into it i used to get mad because i	knew	i could do something and i did n't get it
sw2345-ms98-a-trans	25	2	they	knew	my hours the police told me evidently they were watching
sw2346-ms98-a-trans	53	2	and	knew	what to look for when you went shopping for a
sw2348-ms98-a-trans	87	9	so much went for the mortgage because we	knew	you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you
sw2340-ms98-a-trans	109	10	and it seemed like there several people that i	knew	that had their uh parents i guess they would be
sw2345-ms98-a-trans	93	21	n't know for sure but they hit they took they	knew	right where to go that 's what scares me
sw2345-ms98-a-trans	114	15	they just hit the jewelry well i guess if they	knew	their jewelry they knew their but they did take some
sw2345-ms98-a-trans	114	19	jewelry well i guess if they knew their jewelry they	knew	their but they did take some cubic zirconiums too i
sw2355-ms98-a-trans	62	11	you know what 's going on you know like i	knew	or like i sat in on the meetings or something
sw2366-ms98-a-trans	101	15	a secret background that says somehow or another we just	knew	we were piano players and never g ot a chance
sw2368-ms98-a-trans	143	9	in fact i had more room than i	knew	what to do with i do n't know it 's
sw2376-ms98-a-trans	36	10	so they moved it behind the store and nobody	knew	where it was and so people kept piling stuff in
sw2377-ms98-a-trans	54	3	we we	knew	that we were n't going to have to ever use
sw2377-ms98-a-trans	54	17	n't going to have to ever use it again we	knew	we were going to have two or three weeks of
sw2377-ms98-a-trans	56	25	the test and then you forgot about it because you	knew	you were never going to see it again in the
sw2377-ms98-a-trans	62	4	buy a whole	knew	metric set yeah
sw2380-ms98-a-trans	52	3	and i	knew	the people involved both the people who perjured and the
sw2407-ms98-a-trans	29	6	right and even if i	knew	how to teach the subject matter i do n't know
sw2406-ms98-a-trans	103	9	yeah i read the book before so i	knew	the story line going in but
sw2408-ms98-a-trans	118	20	seen he just i could talk to him and he	knew	what i was saying
sw2409-ms98-a-trans	49	3	so i	knew	that i was running a balance up but it sure
sw2428-ms98-a-trans	33	9	you know i do n't really know i	knew	when i bought it but i do n't know right
sw2428-ms98-a-trans	80	27	game using the uh joy sticks and they never even	knew	i was there except i was sitting there and i
sw2443-ms98-a-trans	62	5	and maybe and i	knew	i wanted to be in engineering so i was looking
sw2443-ms98-a-trans	95	10	yes and and a lot of people that i	knew	had would go to school in some really you you
sw2438-ms98-a-trans	119	22	be a jogger and i said oh if you only	knew	couch potato with remote control
sw2439-ms98-a-trans	134	32	central and offered them the same price as what i	knew	i was gonna be able to get it for in
sw2439-ms98-a-trans	139	30	's so funny is they took the car they i	knew	they were gonna pull it from Town North because that
sw2439-ms98-a-trans	146	51	car and i 'm and i 'm sure he probably	knew	what was going on the very next day of course
sw2439-ms98-a-trans	153	15	and took it to Arlington so i 'm sure he	knew	so i loved it i sat there and i just
sw2446-ms98-a-trans	91	20	of some of the the Peace Corps uh that i	knew	of did marry Peruvians
sw2446-ms98-a-trans	100	6	i had wondered sometimes i	knew	that there was a lot of a lot of effort
sw2452-ms98-a-trans	100	34	any any would be bully would think twice if he	knew	that
sw2467-ms98-a-trans	142	16	a lot of good ideas some of them i already	knew	about some of them i had already practiced but i
sw2459-ms98-a-trans	72	29	red marks all around the nose and mouth and we	knew	immediately
sw2477-ms98-a-trans	54	15	was n't used to that of course i 've i	knew	whenever UNLV went in at half time see i do
sw2481-ms98-a-trans	58	30	a prayer i did n't go up there because i	knew	i did n't have a leg to stand on
sw2468-ms98-a-trans	62	28	was there on business and visiting a family that i	knew	very well in fact the guy had been my boss
sw2476-ms98-a-trans	44	3	she really	knew	that she did n't have to do that but she
sw2476-ms98-a-trans	68	6	oh yeah i 've i	knew	people who did it years ago but they they were
sw2484-ms98-a-trans	52	25	that could be in the hands of of someone who	knew	the law and could be privy to that information seems
sw2485-ms98-a-trans	131	12	it turned out so much better like that because everybody	knew	they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
sw2485-ms98-a-trans	131	14	out so much better like that because everybody knew they	knew	ahead of time how many people to expect
sw2485-ms98-a-trans	143	14	it went to the the oldest people and then they	knew	who they wanted to invite then they sent their little
sw2499-ms98-a-trans	3	4	that 's i	knew	you were going to say that i wanted i want
sw2497-ms98-a-trans	129	17	n't really want to be a lawyer i mean i	knew	that going in i just wanted a law degree because
sw2236-ms98-a-trans	65	11	that would n't really catch my attention but if i	knew	that they had you know really good train layouts i
sw2238-ms98-a-trans	74	3	and we	knew	that it would n't you know we could n't even
sw2238-ms98-a-trans	74	37	just so against and and when you said your mother	knew	that this is probably where she needed to be it
sw2238-ms98-a-trans	96	30	in town you know that same town forever and we	knew	very well and we knew her history and we knew
sw2238-ms98-a-trans	96	35	same town forever and we knew very well and we	knew	her history and we knew that she was n't going
sw2238-ms98-a-trans	96	40	knew very well and we knew her history and we	knew	that she was n't going to steal from him we
sw2238-ms98-a-trans	96	51	that she was n't going to steal from him we	knew	that she would take good care of him and
sw2243-ms98-a-trans	87	15	to you have to be able to prove they they	knew	it was counterfeit and that 's always very difficult
sw2258-ms98-a-trans	24	15	i 'm the same way i tell you i i	knew	better i should have put some sunscreen on uh yesterday
sw2252-ms98-a-trans	90	2	i	knew	a lot of guys in the service when they were
sw2270-ms98-a-trans	93	5	so you if you	knew	what was going on you could kind of anticipate what
sw2268-ms98-a-trans	158	7	wow wow yeah now i never	knew	they were that that big huh
sw2281-ms98-a-trans	30	9	it 's fairly facts whoever he talked to	knew	what uh the had had been in the program uh
sw2275-ms98-a-trans	60	8	uh show to where you never really	knew	
sw2279-ms98-a-trans	94	29	having children because we was still in college and we	knew	
sw2292-ms98-a-trans	32	39	of put things off and only went in when we	knew	there was a problem somewhere and stuff and
sw2283-ms98-a-trans	71	14	she reads all kinds of books so i wish i	knew	more to tell you why but
sw2284-ms98-a-trans	77	9	i mean we would all die if we	knew	what was really going on i mean all of America
sw2287-ms98-a-trans	96	10	no i guess it 'd be best if you	knew	what each person and what they stood for and why
sw2702-ms98-a-trans	55	21	was trade it in on a Spitfire and i i	knew	that was gonna be the only time i could afford
sw2710-ms98-a-trans	3	16	and accepted every one that i was offered because i	knew	it would be easier to go ahead and get them
sw2708-ms98-a-trans	109	8	but uh you know most people i	knew	have gone and got their degree so
sw2709-ms98-a-trans	83	7	and i really do wish i	knew	about quotas and really wish i hi i really do
sw2709-ms98-a-trans	83	21	really wish i hi i really do wish i i	knew	more about immigration laws because i have no idea any
sw2709-ms98-a-trans	88	13	do n't i do n't really either i wish i	knew	more and probably if i did i might be a
sw2709-ms98-a-trans	91	12	and i and even if i i really wish i	knew	the situations they were going back to or coming from
sw2712-ms98-a-trans	176	9	i loved it but most people that i	knew	did n't like it but i thought i was funny
sw2720-ms98-a-trans	26	9	when i was in the second grade i	knew	just about everything that was there i had learned it
sw2726-ms98-a-trans	95	12	find it but when we found it it was we	knew	it yeah
sw2726-ms98-a-trans	96	2	you	knew	that was it i 'll probably i 'll probably move
sw2735-ms98-a-trans	70	9	if he if he drank too much he	knew	he drank too much or or if he was on
sw2735-ms98-a-trans	70	22	too much or or if he was on dope he	knew	he was he was what was going to happen when
sw2733-ms98-a-trans	82	7	both coming and going so i	knew	what i actually got on the trip and it was
sw2734-ms98-a-trans	90	2	i	knew	it was there but i i or proposed or is
sw2750-ms98-a-trans	76	3	well we	knew	generally the time of year uh that we wanted to
sw2768-ms98-a-trans	87	19	something you know they would look forward to if they	knew	you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday
sw2768-ms98-a-trans	110	8	just i do n't know unless i	knew	that they were somewhere just really
sw2778-ms98-a-trans	86	13	not heard of that before but i you know i	knew	that tires were recycled quite you know quite a bit
sw2797-ms98-a-trans	104	14	it everything started to click in for him and he	knew	what he n eeded to do um and this year
sw2509-ms98-a-trans	74	21	real tearjerker so i was pretty much prepared and i	knew	that she i knew that she died so i was
sw2509-ms98-a-trans	74	25	was pretty much prepared and i knew that she i	knew	that she died so i was prepared for that just
sw2513-ms98-a-trans	37	26	managed to get it going again relatively quickly because i	knew	i watched what he did and was able to do
sw2503-ms98-a-trans	57	10	i could just walk in the door and she	knew	whether to to to quietly come up to me or
sw2510-ms98-a-trans	131	4	and i we	knew	it but we never even thought that about when we
sw2514-ms98-a-trans	84	4	no but i	knew	people i was there before that but i knew people
sw2514-ms98-a-trans	84	13	i knew people i was there before that but i	knew	people i got a letter from a friend of mine
sw2514-ms98-a-trans	86	5	um i did i	knew	all of my friends there but none of them that
sw2523-ms98-a-trans	102	11	well yeah we were yeah well we had uh we	knew	some Laotians and and uh the job they took uh
sw2531-ms98-a-trans	41	12	he if he had enough snap to do that he	knew	what he was doing the penalty assessed is death period
sw2545-ms98-a-trans	52	3	yeah i	knew	what you meant yeah
sw2537-ms98-a-trans	69	29	be irate if they said it was positive and i	knew	it was n't you know that just really rub me
sw2539-ms98-a-trans	124	27	and i know i never ever said that because i	knew	that that was one thing that was really irritating to
sw2535-ms98-a-trans	149	3	these boys	knew	that what they were doing was wrong and when i
sw2535-ms98-a-trans	149	23	i screamed at them to stop they kept running they	knew	what they were doing was wrong that 's why i
sw2550-ms98-a-trans	45	37	and i 'd seen all of the shows so i	knew	what was going on
sw2562-ms98-a-trans	92	8	they bought the place but um i	knew	that they would you know if i left like one
sw2585-ms98-a-trans	35	27	information that was free to them anyway if they just	knew	how to get it
sw2804-ms98-a-trans	63	12	i do n't i never really followed them all i	knew	uh
sw2597-ms98-a-trans	95	9	i do n't know they it Schwartzkopf Schwartzkopf	knew	what had to be done and it 's too bad
sw2597-ms98-a-trans	97	7	because he had the few he	knew	what was going to happen more than any of us
sw2597-ms98-a-trans	100	3	and you	knew	this these people are going to come and if you
sw2802-ms98-a-trans	83	4	the the kids	knew	well the teacher the science teachers were pretty sharp too
sw2814-ms98-a-trans	34	30	gave us a lot of clues you just wish you	knew	all this stuff going in that um
sw2806-ms98-a-trans	51	8	but i fed him and he he	knew	how to get me to feed him he 'd come
sw2811-ms98-a-trans	105	10	well i bought it from a fellow that i	knew	uh that worked up here it had sixty nine thousand
sw2817-ms98-a-trans	55	56	just for herself and then she fell down and nobody	knew	about it for hours and hours and hours and
sw2818-ms98-a-trans	69	12	having lived in a community for a while and we	knew	the person to whom we were entrusting our children and
sw2833-ms98-a-trans	30	5	um-hum um-hum yeah i	knew	they had one but i just i guess i assumed
sw2838-ms98-a-trans	28	6	intelligent enough to uh he	knew	where booth both places were loaded the gun and they
sw2838-ms98-a-trans	35	19	children growing up uh i um uh once uh uh	knew	a fellow that had had been a policeman and he
sw2845-ms98-a-trans	51	3	and people	knew	it people knew that you know this person put out
sw2845-ms98-a-trans	51	6	and people knew it people	knew	that you know this person put out this kind of
sw2838-ms98-a-trans	42	36	those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you	knew	the guy was coming and had time to do anything
sw2840-ms98-a-trans	67	27	the in the field that i was in whereas i	knew	people that
sw2847-ms98-a-trans	104	3	yeah i	knew	his literary agent in Houston when she was just uh
sw2859-ms98-a-trans	36	17	game and i was n't even aware i mean i	knew	it but i just i guess i kind of shut
sw2853-ms98-a-trans	128	14	just per se my husband 's friend that you know	knew	that a pee test was coming up he would ask
sw2869-ms98-a-trans	53	14	n't a uh real for people such as myself that	knew	they wanted to go to school and knew they wanted
sw2869-ms98-a-trans	53	22	myself that knew they wanted to go to school and	knew	they wanted to um go to a fairly competitive undergraduate
sw2869-ms98-a-trans	104	9	and it there were things that i probably	knew	about in other segments but they just did n't offer
sw2869-ms98-a-trans	114	32	i mean it was sort of just like uh you	knew	you had to study or you just did n't
sw2877-ms98-a-trans	155	4	and so she	knew	that i had the time and would be would enjoy
sw2879-ms98-a-trans	51	7	and i had you know i	knew	some people that said why are you glad you did
sw2882-ms98-a-trans	127	5	Reagan too Reagan he	knew	about it
sw2882-ms98-a-trans	150	5	well well if i	knew	more about it like i said if they would get
sw2891-ms98-a-trans	68	2	i	knew	going into it that it
sw2884-ms98-a-trans	117	8	we 're still pretty close and i	knew	her spending habits and and they 're about the same
sw2888-ms98-a-trans	127	13	all the information within minutes you know whatever happened we	knew	about it about the same time that they knew about
sw2888-ms98-a-trans	127	22	we knew about it about the same time that they	knew	about it
sw2899-ms98-a-trans	34	2	i	knew	nothing about what it was going to be like it
sw2600-ms98-a-trans	100	30	then the guy says you have a temperature well i	knew	that
sw2603-ms98-a-trans	144	4	that 's i	knew	i was pushing too far
sw2612-ms98-a-trans	50	6	and on the other they	knew	very
sw2614-ms98-a-trans	57	18	cab when i was a graduate student so i i	knew	uh
sw2614-ms98-a-trans	59	5	and certainly you know	knew	that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that
sw2614-ms98-a-trans	59	8	and certainly you know knew that problem	knew	you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight
sw2614-ms98-a-trans	59	11	and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know	knew	about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or
sw2612-ms98-a-trans	115	17	put it together and he 's the only one who	knew	how it worked or supposedly worked
sw2623-ms98-a-trans	50	22	and going out and doing things and you know i	knew	like the kids next door were all into cocaine and
sw2626-ms98-a-trans	127	5	yes that um he	knew	you know what to expect out of Saddam Saddam Hussein
sw2638-ms98-a-trans	36	4	yeah so you	knew	you know the atmosphere then
sw2637-ms98-a-trans	37	27	one time and the grocery stores i mean the people	knew	when i asked for the beef skirt that you use
sw2638-ms98-a-trans	82	17	least began was in the talking stage you know everybody	knew	it was coming it just a matter of time everybody
sw2631-ms98-a-trans	58	20	piece of mind and when i taught school and i	knew	my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus
sw2630-ms98-a-trans	62	4	yeah so he	knew	the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which
sw2630-ms98-a-trans	62	27	hundred and he had visited his brother at Amherst and	knew	that he liked the environment but he did go on
sw2630-ms98-a-trans	93	4	yeah and he	knew	and if it came down i mean as he came
sw2633-ms98-a-trans	59	38	to the nursery and i had somebody there everybody i	knew	was going to be at the wedding so i knew
sw2633-ms98-a-trans	59	48	knew was going to be at the wedding so i	knew	i had to find somebody i did n't know to
sw2630-ms98-a-trans	135	10	it was easy for him to rule out he	knew	what he did n't want that 's exactly yeah now
sw2630-ms98-a-trans	138	16	as happy as a bed bug he the moment he	knew	he he decided early on that Amherst was the school
sw2645-ms98-a-trans	51	18	it it it 's getting better all the time i	knew	it would be different from the very beginning but you
sw2646-ms98-a-trans	85	43	time and it was on a Friday night and we	knew	the place would be really busy but we
sw2647-ms98-a-trans	115	4	and because i	knew	all along that 's what i wanted even even though
sw2643-ms98-a-trans	190	11	i did n't know you were that far inland i	knew	it was a ways but
sw2648-ms98-a-trans	140	5	so uh yeah i	knew	i think there 's lots that be that could be
sw2650-ms98-a-trans	45	5	uh i i just	knew	today uh you know we looked at the pound and
sw2650-ms98-a-trans	46	12	that we just went all over the place and i	knew	we were going to find him you know and when
sw2651-ms98-a-trans	45	14	what we wanted so we did some research and i	knew	the land there 's a lot of ledge up here
sw2658-ms98-a-trans	26	11	and we called up the company that somebody else we	knew	had dealt with and they were very happy with the
sw2654-ms98-a-trans	80	42	'd be glad to share it with everybody if i	knew	
sw2658-ms98-a-trans	83	10	uh i was recording and the next thing i	knew	the tape was chewed up in the thing
sw2658-ms98-a-trans	91	13	was wondering like you know in our case we we	knew	we were buying a copy we were n't buying an
sw2650-ms98-a-trans	142	12	oh it was terrible i just felt terrible and i	knew	something was wrong with him because his appetite was he
sw2670-ms98-a-trans	56	5	and um so i	knew	
sw2668-ms98-a-trans	66	8	and and had more money than i	knew	what to do with so i started making accelerated house
sw2670-ms98-a-trans	147	16	few scenes where i did but this one scene i	knew	something bad was coming i could tell so i ducked
sw2671-ms98-a-trans	111	24	know Circus magazine in nineteen seventy two that David Bowie	knew	so and so well i had this get you know
sw2671-ms98-a-trans	114	3	but i	knew	that David Bowie produced it right so if David Bowie
sw2668-ms98-a-trans	131	29	they 're not it it 's interesting i wish i	knew	this question was coming up because i 've only heard
sw2687-ms98-a-trans	14	29	uh the police department would call TI security when they	knew	they were in town basically and say
sw2687-ms98-a-trans	106	3	okay i	knew	it was something like that and i thought jeez that
sw2687-ms98-a-trans	108	17	other things in hearing other things you know if i	knew	two of my friends got hung for carrying a little
sw2699-ms98-a-trans	132	3	and i	knew	i had n't bumped anything but i had taken it
sw3004-ms98-a-trans	127	19	you enjoy them more uh somebody somebody said if they	knew	grandchildren where so much fun they 'd of had them
sw3009-ms98-a-trans	29	14	only thing people ever asked me well of course they	knew	i came from a family with younger kids but they
sw3009-ms98-a-trans	40	45	younger lady she did n't really know my mom she	knew	my mom by name and that was it
sw3009-ms98-a-trans	42	2	she	knew	that i was one of the oldest girls in my
sw3009-ms98-a-trans	51	14	with you but there again she she you know she	knew	
sw3009-ms98-a-trans	52	1		knew	of your family and she and she met in a
sw3011-ms98-a-trans	104	21	a single family home and that 's all i ever	knew	growing up so i stayed in a townhouse for uh
sw3020-ms98-a-trans	37	8	and we had nothing taken because we	knew	and we had things in inside pockets and in you
sw3016-ms98-a-trans	80	5	oh i never even	knew	that
sw3031-ms98-a-trans	31	18	just laugh and laugh my family would die if they	knew	all these things my kids were eating
sw3036-ms98-a-trans	21	32	just it was it was n't part of what i	knew	so
sw3038-ms98-a-trans	60	3	and they	knew	that she was n't going to come back but yeah
sw3038-ms98-a-trans	105	20	in a in a weekend and uh it was you	knew	what was going to happen of course
sw3053-ms98-a-trans	90	26	read American Demographics which you know i had never even	knew	that magazine existed but it had some really neat stuff
sw3053-ms98-a-trans	110	5	their 's i never	knew	all the specific things they had in magazines
sw3059-ms98-a-trans	72	8	how it would get there but you	knew	where it would end up
sw3058-ms98-a-trans	30	32	do n't know if it was interesting just because i	knew	the person who 'd written it or if it was
sw3067-ms98-a-trans	45	17	people have and and at time you know they all	knew	one another
sw3069-ms98-a-trans	8	3	but i	knew	as soon as i heard your voice i thought Kathy
sw3071-ms98-a-trans	57	15	into his his office every now and then you never	knew	what kind of music he 'd be playing on the
sw3072-ms98-a-trans	110	26	n't ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany	knew	English and everyone in Switzerland knew English
sw3072-ms98-a-trans	110	32	because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland	knew	English
sw3072-ms98-a-trans	113	22	were in and got seated and then no on e	knew	English in there and we were just
sw3076-ms98-a-trans	127	6	area of people whom i	knew	and how they were going to vote they did n't
sw3085-ms98-a-trans	93	32	me please do n't do that to me so i	knew	it was time to go back to work but i
sw3090-ms98-a-trans	13	11	spent whatever came in and and uh did n't never	knew	what came in what went out but uh just you
sw3088-ms98-a-trans	73	12	i i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i	knew	was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol i 'd
sw2915-ms98-a-trans	30	16	in the paper and i said well you know he	knew	he was making money somebody he did n't look that
sw2924-ms98-a-trans	92	25	could make a real good case if he you know	knew	all the details of the defendant 's you know case
sw2933-ms98-a-trans	38	3	if you	knew	that uh long term the
sw2934-ms98-a-trans	70	10	so of course that woke everybody up and we	knew	what was going on to uh you know go downstairs
sw2935-ms98-a-trans	68	41	energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever	knew	him
sw2928-ms98-a-trans	104	44	available to recycle the oil i was wondering if you	knew	anything about that
sw2941-ms98-a-trans	43	12	had to wear that uniform to work and so you	knew	what you was going to wear was n't no what
sw2937-ms98-a-trans	87	23	in the government so before it was over with he	knew	that she was divorced she had two children what school
sw2937-ms98-a-trans	87	43	school they went to what her average income was he	knew	that she 'd gotten a boat in the divorce because
sw2937-ms98-a-trans	89	2	he	knew	all about her
sw2943-ms98-a-trans	138	29	with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they	knew	well and trusted um and
sw2944-ms98-a-trans	68	22	but i guess having done this all my life i	knew	that there was n't a problem and and it indeed
sw2945-ms98-a-trans	150	20	think about it that much i mean you know i	knew	i was aware vaguely aware of it but um i
sw2951-ms98-a-trans	20	24	to my car loan through the credit union which i	knew	was lower interest just to pay them all off and
sw2955-ms98-a-trans	33	7	i do n't know technically we	knew	what we were doing either then you heard about the
sw2951-ms98-a-trans	120	3	and they	knew	that yes they knew that they were going to do
sw2951-ms98-a-trans	120	7	and they knew that yes they	knew	that they were going to do that and they just
sw2958-ms98-a-trans	75	14	where he uh became fairly stable i mean he he	knew	who we were when we went in to visit him
sw2956-ms98-a-trans	87	38	i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he	knew	it he actually knew it and being associated with government
sw2956-ms98-a-trans	87	42	happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually	knew	it and being associated with government he should be held
sw2958-ms98-a-trans	96	11	and it got to the point where um they we	knew	them just as much as they knew us and and
sw2958-ms98-a-trans	96	18	um they we knew them just as much as they	knew	us and and they really cared for him at you
sw2964-ms98-a-trans	108	9	with those people behind the counter before they	knew	it
sw2964-ms98-a-trans	142	19	for murder and the guy jumped up and and apparently	knew	where the judge kept his gun
sw2979-ms98-a-trans	9	36	ago i did n't think of it that much i	knew	about all the the uh
sw2970-ms98-a-trans	51	17	know how your folks were but i mean i sure	knew	as heck when i was growing up that uh my
sw2988-ms98-a-trans	51	5	i mean they just	knew	that they had to toe the line otherwise they would
sw2991-ms98-a-trans	76	26	's really easy and they were like well i never	knew	that and that obviously they 'd never considered looking it
sw3305-ms98-a-trans	79	8	yeah she says this is home she	knew	right where the bed was she laid on my pillow
sw3310-ms98-a-trans	33	3	if they	knew	that i came in there at all different hours
sw3310-ms98-a-trans	37	8	i would go certain hours and they	knew	and if i 'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered you
sw3310-ms98-a-trans	39	36	would have to raise so i got to where i	knew	then when my mother was in
sw3310-ms98-a-trans	77	7	she no as far as she	knew	she was going to a hospital
sw3318-ms98-a-trans	17	11	oh really i did n't know the story but i	knew	it got a good review
sw3330-ms98-a-trans	34	15	have that much to do they just uh they just	knew	they wanted to go to college and and i you
sw3361-ms98-a-trans	8	3	oh you	knew	of the homes then you knew of the homes themselves
sw3361-ms98-a-trans	8	9	oh you knew of the homes then you	knew	of the homes themselves
sw3367-ms98-a-trans	19	13	you know not gruesome but but something where where people	knew	that it was it was a deterrent and it was
sw3380-ms98-a-trans	27	12	know to to keep their morale up uh when they	knew	that we were n't really trying to win and and
sw3102-ms98-a-trans	52	3	and i	knew	that Clarion was known you know for two things actually
sw3106-ms98-a-trans	5	2	i	knew	that was you well this should be a good one
sw3104-ms98-a-trans	84	21	college out of state or anyplace else and i just	knew	that the finances you know would not support it if
sw3102-ms98-a-trans	133	32	i was more interested and that 's what i i	knew	that 's what i wanted
sw3117-ms98-a-trans	34	22	i lacked was the uh interaction between uh students i	knew	everybody within my dorm but that was it
sw3117-ms98-a-trans	36	19	whereas my sister when i went to visit her she	knew	everybody on the whole durn campus
sw3117-ms98-a-trans	82	30	and she did n't get to do that although she	knew	people who did live there but yeah that 's that
sw3124-ms98-a-trans	22	17	you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never	knew	if it was going to be a go or not
sw3126-ms98-a-trans	40	2	we	knew	a bunch of the striper guides and and so we
sw3137-ms98-a-trans	39	25	at all but we had these two that they we	knew	someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid
sw3143-ms98-a-trans	31	9	yeah i think so i think if they	knew	it was going to be really horrible wherever they were
sw3144-ms98-a-trans	72	17	would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but	knew	that
sw3144-ms98-a-trans	75	21	it all and he said well realistically you know he	knew	he could n't get them all in but uh Jay
sw3143-ms98-a-trans	56	26	any personal you know i never met anybody that i	knew	had anything to do with it or seen anybody but
sw3143-ms98-a-trans	74	45	it was so well publicized that everybody in the area	knew	that town would n't be patrolled as well
sw3164-ms98-a-trans	30	3	uh-huh i	knew	they were gonna show his butt in there somewhere
sw3164-ms98-a-trans	90	12	yes well he would n't defend a case because he	knew	they were lying
sw3188-ms98-a-trans	14	57	realize that i needed that i mean i kind of	knew	in the back of my mind
sw3187-ms98-a-trans	23	17	family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and	knew	was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away
sw3200-ms98-a-trans	53	31	a vacation and saved all that money so because i	knew	that you could n't you know spending five thousand dollars
sw3218-ms98-a-trans	47	9	the town you know just outside Dallas and	knew	somebody that lived in the country so we 're wondering
sw3225-ms98-a-trans	80	6	me either i wish i	knew	more about it
sw3224-ms98-a-trans	59	6	uh-huh that 's right i	knew	some people going up there
sw3240-ms98-a-trans	14	4	okay i i	knew	somebody who said they were easy to uh litter box
sw3244-ms98-a-trans	13	8	it would uh smell the continuous you	knew	that you were also breathing that into your lungs so
sw3269-ms98-a-trans	5	10	and uh then we moved here even when we	knew	we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans
sw3271-ms98-a-trans	34	48	because he was really skittish but it was like he	knew	
sw3265-ms98-a-trans	16	9	oh well i did n't realize it i	knew	that one of the
sw3273-ms98-a-trans	103	16	guess i never was awakened to it you know i	knew	it was out there but i knew you know i
sw3273-ms98-a-trans	103	23	you know i knew it was out there but i	knew	you know i did n't know it was to a
sw3278-ms98-a-trans	28	10	and uh took us out there and you never	knew	that there was so much land that was not developed
sw3293-ms98-a-trans	44	45	the little stuff that we just were so amazed she	knew	how to do you know could n't believe
sw3403-ms98-a-trans	43	30	being he was put in the which i 'd never	knew	exist the Restaurant Hall of Fame
sw3405-ms98-a-trans	31	34	miles and miles around to get that corn because they	knew	it was individually picked
sw3408-ms98-a-trans	40	6	you know and and they	knew	you
sw3414-ms98-a-trans	12	3	so they	knew	that there was something going on here so they started
sw3426-ms98-a-trans	86	18	a Texan i i just thought life would be i	knew	it was easier back here
sw3434-ms98-a-trans	82	2	i	knew	some women that they in fact they still
sw3460-ms98-a-trans	59	15	public would be you know uh tremendously upset if they	knew	
sw3469-ms98-a-trans	14	6	exactly my mother uh actually	knew	a woman uh in another state that used to marry
sw3468-ms98-a-trans	46	24	Austin when they started uh talking about you know they	knew	they needed to paint their house and they got some
sw3494-ms98-a-trans	11	3	well i	knew	that you were sick for our last meeting did you
sw3702-ms98-a-trans	38	16	what i might read about a place if somebody i	knew	and cared about liked a place and said no this
sw3493-ms98-a-trans	80	10	so it was really interesting and i wish i	knew	if they were still in deliberations but i do n't
sw3493-ms98-a-trans	89	31	my whole life because i mean as far as i	knew	this could take months some of them do
sw3704-ms98-a-trans	48	7	and good grief if my parents	knew	what my long distance bill was every month they 'd
sw3725-ms98-a-trans	95	19	still you wind up meeting people you you you never	knew	you were related to let alone
sw3749-ms98-a-trans	23	8	whereas you know all my professors i	knew	they were PhD 's or whatever and that they were
sw3756-ms98-a-trans	57	36	cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he	knew	that so
sw3505-ms98-a-trans	21	5	a lady that i	knew	that had a uh gift shop and she gave art
sw3795-ms98-a-trans	62	12	may not have been perfect but they did what they	knew	how to do and they did it the best they
sw3795-ms98-a-trans	62	23	how to do and they did it the best they	knew	how so
sw3507-ms98-a-trans	65	10	well i do n't think they uh think they	knew	they could n't afford
sw3527-ms98-a-trans	74	4	hm but you	knew	when you moved in you 'd have to pay that
sw3527-ms98-a-trans	94	30	know there the machine that 'll do it because he	knew	so many people that broke it through their water main
sw3547-ms98-a-trans	54	2	she	knew	that the gun that i had was not to be
sw3547-ms98-a-trans	68	6	uh if they if they	knew	what they were playing with
sw3559-ms98-a-trans	29	45	my sister in law was saying the other day she	knew	of a place little place down in
sw3553-ms98-a-trans	43	10	uh which was an internal family deal i i	knew	that if something happened and my sister could n't take
sw3553-ms98-a-trans	64	32	fact she got to where she enjoyed it there she	knew	the staff and knew the other people that were there
sw3553-ms98-a-trans	64	36	where she enjoyed it there she knew the staff and	knew	the other people that were there and and in fact
sw3556-ms98-a-trans	48	24	passing of the guard i mean and i think Tom	knew	it
sw3567-ms98-a-trans	34	10	and the nice thing about it too is i	knew	that i wanted to get into business
sw3577-ms98-a-trans	44	6	yeah i wonder if Yeltsin	knew	how far it 'd go when he climbed on top
sw3614-ms98-a-trans	61	20	uh residence in um England through a guy that we	knew	that had a flat there
sw3614-ms98-a-trans	69	27	inside information about where i was headed and so i	knew	uh kind of what i was getting into but if
sw3618-ms98-a-trans	33	32	facilities about her and she did n't i mean she	knew	that they were doing it wrong
sw3621-ms98-a-trans	47	21	a TA once a week and even the TAs rarely	knew	who you were so
sw3630-ms98-a-trans	77	22	time with us and he wants to you we always	knew	that that he was there for us if we needed
sw3648-ms98-a-trans	58	19	n't heard what it was he was carrying all i	knew	is he 'd been in there shooting i had n't
sw3672-ms98-a-trans	42	18	really almost on the other side of town said she	knew	of one place where you could go and so once
sw3672-ms98-a-trans	43	33	away from us and that 's the only one she	knew	of
sw3676-ms98-a-trans	80	16	's a mystery it was very predictable i mean you	knew	you knew when the murder was gonna happen or something
sw3676-ms98-a-trans	80	18	mystery it was very predictable i mean you knew you	knew	when the murder was gonna happen or something but it
sw3698-ms98-a-trans	30	29	in the legal profession i thought maybe if enough people	knew	about the problem maybe we could do something about it
sw3691-ms98-a-trans	70	2	they	knew	the sucker when they saw one so now we have
sw3693-ms98-a-trans	64	26	find day care would be a small someone that i	knew	
sw4007-ms98-a-trans	27	3	but he	knew	it was Peter Pan it 's just he did n't
sw4022-ms98-a-trans	49	24	payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he	knew	that that um
sw4067-ms98-a-trans	26	9	there was a set of things that she	knew	she was covered for and uh and
sw4094-ms98-a-trans	27	26	the same high school as i did and we all	knew	when she was taken and he had been under suspicion
sw3801-ms98-a-trans	17	11	i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i	knew	that i was not going to sleep until i got
sw4091-ms98-a-trans	78	20	also you know i 've seen a lot of i	knew	somebody who worked for Digital and for two years he
sw3803-ms98-a-trans	12	14	to know that the people who had them at least	knew	what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not
sw3803-ms98-a-trans	12	37	at least there 's the moral issue that they they	knew	better
sw3812-ms98-a-trans	90	2	i	knew	it i 'm a member too that 's why i
sw3805-ms98-a-trans	62	20	know uh set us into a deeper depression if we	knew	the whole picture
sw3817-ms98-a-trans	51	3	i never	knew	that i i always i thought the children like the
sw3820-ms98-a-trans	32	13	i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she	knew	more of the history than course than i did of
sw3820-ms98-a-trans	38	10	and my graduate program that i was in we	knew	some people who were in Beijing
sw3820-ms98-a-trans	43	2	we	knew	there were people contacts we had there
sw3842-ms98-a-trans	24	28	he always said that that was the best way he	knew	of to wind to wind down after a hard day
sw3843-ms98-a-trans	88	4	but i never	knew	for sure i met them once or twice because they
sw3843-ms98-a-trans	90	7	i never really considered that i	knew	them so
sw3846-ms98-a-trans	83	4	yeah so you	knew	what you wanted to do yeah yeah
sw3863-ms98-a-trans	55	9	and uh she never saw it she never	knew	anything about it
sw3861-ms98-a-trans	53	19	were already little kids so nobody in my family really	knew	how to advise me
sw3880-ms98-a-trans	20	2	i	knew	it was going to be sad and i knew somebody
sw3880-ms98-a-trans	20	11	i knew it was going to be sad and i	knew	somebody was going to be dying
sw4400-ms98-a-trans	15	12	know i 've i had good luck and uh i	knew	enough about all the the basic maintenance you know brakes
sw4440-ms98-a-trans	68	6	like the the parent i	knew	some ham and uh
sw4443-ms98-a-trans	50	4	i mean you	knew	it yeah i never really thought it was would be
sw4467-ms98-a-trans	11	50	by the time i got through reading that booklet i	knew	exactly what the issues were
sw4400-ms98-a-trans	69	27	and he said you know i he said he he	knew	it would sound biased but he said that about uh
sw4497-ms98-a-trans	49	15	had apparently it 's like a retirement community and they	knew	a lot of friends who had done the same thing
sw3910-ms98-a-trans	57	12	um i guess if that 's the only thing you	knew	well you would just know well i weigh seventy something
sw3925-ms98-a-trans	29	17	in campaigns would be more to the point if you	knew	what you were getting when you voted uh yeah
sw3930-ms98-a-trans	48	25	the crime rate was very low over there because people	knew	the consequences
sw3927-ms98-a-trans	82	4	yeah okay i	knew	i knew something about that uh-huh
sw3927-ms98-a-trans	82	6	yeah okay i knew i	knew	something about that uh-huh
sw3952-ms98-a-trans	53	22	i can tell you about my exercising i wish i	knew	how to swim but i do n't so i do
sw3963-ms98-a-trans	23	10	and after i got the first roll back i	knew	the camera was n't it so i uh i took
sw3963-ms98-a-trans	49	31	a good quality name on it and you know they	knew	the quality of it before they bought it
sw3979-ms98-a-trans	23	8	and in reality in many cases they	knew	or they had information about you that was purchased from
sw3980-ms98-a-trans	47	13	hilarious must have been right when you said something i	knew	that was you i was like oh my gosh
sw3983-ms98-a-trans	20	6	probably not uh we already	knew	we wanted to take one and we just started looking
sw3991-ms98-a-trans	60	4	and uh i	knew	um
sw4206-ms98-a-trans	42	9	a thing a a while back and he	knew	one of the guys that got in trouble for i
sw4210-ms98-a-trans	55	4	you know i	knew	that the air in Philadelphia was not the greatest when
sw4224-ms98-a-trans	25	17	my friends who watch CNN all the time they like	knew	these guys
sw4232-ms98-a-trans	45	3	so i	knew	what i was talking about and they really i mean
sw4236-ms98-a-trans	88	3	we we	knew	about one funk band that we were excited about that
sw4258-ms98-a-trans	51	6	but i think that i	knew	other people from other public schools who got better educations
sw4266-ms98-a-trans	31	23	people who grow up saying i felt i never really	knew	my father
sw4266-ms98-a-trans	43	3	i always	knew	that my dad loved me he but he never really
sw4266-ms98-a-trans	46	5	but uh i always	knew	it i mean he always he always did things so
sw4266-ms98-a-trans	46	18	mean he always he always did things so that i	knew	it
sw4270-ms98-a-trans	37	6	uh you i really never	knew	who was really telling the truth and who was n't
sw4267-ms98-a-trans	66	16	some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you	knew	he was shot and dead
sw4273-ms98-a-trans	19	18	that she bought that they actually sell which we never	knew	of um
sw4272-ms98-a-trans	61	16	a definition of insanity of whether they or not they	knew	what they were doing that 's a little different than
sw4273-ms98-a-trans	57	13	that testing can be really bogus you know because we	knew	people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just
sw4273-ms98-a-trans	69	2	she	knew	that public schools could be pretty bad
sw4286-ms98-a-trans	44	7	you know i just said i	knew	that i would find somebody that would do this at
sw4289-ms98-a-trans	17	6	but my dad had a	knew	uh what was going on but she did n't and
sw4289-ms98-a-trans	18	5	several people in town	knew	what was going on but they never did tell her
sw4291-ms98-a-trans	38	2	i	knew	what i wanted and i was i was i was
sw4291-ms98-a-trans	63	3	yeah i	knew	uh
sw4594-ms98-a-trans	5	8	i got to where i mean i	knew	where every penny was going but then as i started
sw4594-ms98-a-trans	26	30	a strict budget it 's because i had too i	knew	exactly where every penny was going before i had it
sw4104-ms98-a-trans	65	11	i just picked it up off the street and i	knew	what i was i knew what i was communicating but
sw4104-ms98-a-trans	65	16	off the street and i knew what i was i	knew	what i was communicating but i did n't know what
sw4105-ms98-a-trans	27	20	i 'm not a clock watcher if i if i	knew	they were expecting me there
sw4129-ms98-a-trans	22	24	if if the person who 's gonna commit the crime	knew	that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment
sw4136-ms98-a-trans	18	11	and uh when you when i did that i really	knew	stuff you know i mean if you read the whole
sw4153-ms98-a-trans	65	29	the it was a husband and wife team and we	knew	them from other associations but
sw4178-ms98-a-trans	13	8	yes you know trying to see who	knew	where who else lived and what have you and also
sw4178-ms98-a-trans	60	9	and uh since she was an employee she	knew	what the schedule was and knew when it 'd be
sw4178-ms98-a-trans	60	15	was an employee she knew what the schedule was and	knew	when it 'd be free signed up and and reserved
sw4183-ms98-a-trans	5	5	and next thing i	knew	well he went ahead and kept uh the room here
sw4183-ms98-a-trans	5	27	paying for it after he graduated and next thing i	knew	they had kicked the Rottweiler out so he came back
sw4185-ms98-a-trans	10	6	my dad i never really	knew	my dad um he was just a man in the
sw4183-ms98-a-trans	67	5	and next thing i	knew	man it 'd gotten till it really smelled of the
sw4189-ms98-a-trans	86	15	that and this morning about oh fifteen minutes after i	knew	they 'd started that i
sw4190-ms98-a-trans	29	2	i	knew	which tooth it was and he knew it was too
sw4190-ms98-a-trans	29	9	i knew which tooth it was and he	knew	it was too and all i needed was extract it
sw4194-ms98-a-trans	3	52	where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just	knew	what they were
sw4194-ms98-a-trans	39	27	at one point some girls in a sorority that i	knew	uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me
sw4315-ms98-a-trans	87	36	what they were trying to uh i mean the they	knew	he did it that he was guilty it was just
sw4348-ms98-a-trans	36	5	you know we we	knew	what we we 're you know we knew what we
sw4348-ms98-a-trans	36	13	we we knew what we we 're you know we	knew	what we were up against
sw4352-ms98-a-trans	42	18	out eventually and starts to have problems so i i	knew	that you know i definitely i definitely was n't gonna
sw4357-ms98-a-trans	42	19	month and she was really bad we you know we	knew	it was coming
sw4367-ms98-a-trans	20	2	i	knew	i could i would be able to do that and
sw4376-ms98-a-trans	54	9	and let me tell you uh i i	knew	them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh
sw4377-ms98-a-trans	86	4	and he already	knew	that it was n't a software problem
sw4384-ms98-a-trans	84	56	that you know did it in their house that i	knew	well
sw4611-ms98-a-trans	34	21	realize that what they print is stuff that you probably	knew	already and the stuff that you want they 're not
sw4608-ms98-a-trans	80	4	where a guy	knew	he was gonna get robbed
sw4626-ms98-a-trans	27	10	it was just that when that was empty you	knew	you were out of money
sw4642-ms98-a-trans	69	12	and so idiots as we were neither one of us	knew	much about cars we you know they told us we
sw4664-ms98-a-trans	71	30	about taking any personal time anyway unless you know they	knew	about it or whatever but um
sw4684-ms98-a-trans	6	31	at school and uh the person i was traveling with	knew	a lot about it
sw4691-ms98-a-trans	27	40	know a little more than i used to i never	knew	very much at all so
sw4693-ms98-a-trans	36	23	friendships but my kids went every year and therefore they	knew	you know a lot of the other kids
sw4803-ms98-a-trans	30	37	you went to a hospital there in Germany that they	knew	they could bill uncle Sam for that hospital care
sw4811-ms98-a-trans	66	22	of a crying shame i have been divorced and i	knew	that uh when i was divorced i was allowed that
sw4825-ms98-a-trans	70	6	at at the time i	knew	what it did and what it was called but i
sw4856-ms98-a-trans	32	14	and and the court found him competent um and he	knew	what he was doing and everything else i mean you
sw4858-ms98-a-trans	52	24	they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you	knew	you knew who was good you knew who was bad
sw4858-ms98-a-trans	52	26	know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you	knew	who was good you knew who was bad and it
sw4858-ms98-a-trans	52	31	valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you	knew	who was bad and it was a it was a
sw4886-ms98-a-trans	22	3	and you	knew	how you knew how to do the framing
sw4886-ms98-a-trans	22	6	and you knew how you	knew	how to do the framing
sw4886-ms98-a-trans	23	5	um well my dad	knew	how to do most of it you know he
sw4716-ms98-a-trans	56	14	an interest in them being in the fact that i	knew	that guns could kill and i had four brothers and
sw4716-ms98-a-trans	59	11	and so it was kind of the idea that we	knew	that a gun could kill and that a gun was
sw4716-ms98-a-trans	69	14	before i was old enough to remember but and i	knew	we had the guns in the house and the the
sw4716-ms98-a-trans	72	41	go get the gun out it was just something you	knew	was there and the it was your father 's and
sw4723-ms98-a-trans	41	29	i just went back and signed the papers and i	knew	nothing about my car when i got it nothing i
sw4901-ms98-a-trans	54	13	i i i 'd feel comfortable with it if i	knew	absolutely certainly that this person actually murdered someone
