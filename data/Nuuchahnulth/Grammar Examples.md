# Suffix Migration

The pages in the UCPL book where Toshi discusses this phenomenon are:
- pp. 19–25
- pp. 38–42

Suffix migration can happen when a lexical suffix has semantic scope over the phrase.

# 1
čʼaapaciiɬ
čʼapac ‑iːɬ
canoe  ‑making
‘He made a canoe.’ (elicited)
(Nakayama 2001: 19)

# 2
ƛuliiɬ       čʼapac
ƛul  ‑iːɬ    čʼapac
nice ‑making canoe
‘He made a nice canoe.’ (elicited)
(Nakayama 2001: 19)

# 3
ʔiiḥiiɬ         ƛuɬ  čʼapac
ʔiˑḥ    ‑iːɬ    ƛuɬ  čʼapac
greatly ‑making nice canoe
‘He made a very nice canoe.’ (elicited)
(Nakayama 2001: 19)

# 4
kʼacḥaʕinɬit
kʼacḥaq ‑ʼinɬ         ‑it
blanket -distributing -PAST
‘He gave out blankets.’ (discourse)
(Nakayama 2001: 20)

# 5
ʔayaʔinɬit               kʼacḥaq
ʔaya ‑ʼinɬ         ‑it   kʼacḥaq
many ‑distributing ‑PAST blanket
‘He gave out many blankets.’ (discourse)
(Nakayama 2001: 20)

# 6
čʼapacʼuɬs
čʼapac ‑ʼuˑɬ   ‑s
canoe  ‑owning ‑1.SG
‘I own a canoe.’ (discourse)
(Nakayama 2001: 20)

# 7
ʔiiwʼuuɬs           čʼapac
ʔiːḥʷ ‑ʼuˑɬ   ‑s    čʼapac
large ‑owning ‑1.SG canoe
‘I own a big canoe.’ (discourse)
(Nakayama 2001: 20)

Mood suffixes also show migratory behavior. Person suffixes are often fused with mood suffixes, but can occur alone. Person suffixes must always occur on the main predicate.

# 8
ḥawʼiɬʔiš
ḥawʼiɬ ‑ʔiˑš
chief  ‑IND.3
‘He is a chief.’
(Nakayama 2001: 39)

# 9
ƛuɬʔiiš     ḥawʼiɬ
ƛuɬ  ‑ʔiˑš  ḥawʼiɬ
good ‑IND.3 chief
‘He is a good chief.’
(Nakayama 2001: 39)

# 10
ʔiiḥʔiš       ƛuɬ  ḥawʼiɬ
ʔiˑḥ   ‑ʔiˑš  ƛuɬ  ḥawʼiɬ
really ‑IND.3 good chief
‘He is a really good chief.’
(Nakayama 2001: 39)

Aspectual suffixes do _not_ show migratory behavior. (Lexical suffixes seem to be inserted  between roots and aspectual suffixes? Toshi’s grammar isn’t clear.)

It seems like there’s some variability as to the ordering of the aspectual and lexical affixes.

# Serialization

* Manner
* Time
* Location
* Comitative _ʔukʷink_
* Prepositional _qʷayacʼiik_ 'doing to'
* Accompanying Action / Situation
* Relation 'for, with reference to, together, by, according to'
* Entity-Relating _qu-_

# Possession

* V + POSS: subject N = possessor
* N + POSS: N = possessee
