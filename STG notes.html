<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Given my role in this committee, I will focus mostly on the quantitative parts of the draft, but I share Bill’s concerns regarding the brevity of Section 3.3, which indeed requires quite a bit more explanation of how the words and their uses were annotated.</p>
</div>
<div id="minor-comments" class="section level1">
<h1>Minor comments</h1>
<ul>
<li>p. 94: 39 our 734 clauses is not 3.8% but 5.3%;</li>
<li>p. 99-102: it is not clear to me how the dispersion values were computed. I mean, yes, Danny’s using my measure, which has good empirical support, but the measure, like nearly all others, requires a division of the corpus into parts, which are usually files, which usually correspond to sampled texts. So, for the OANC, no problem, but what’s the corresponding corpus-part unit for the Nuuchahnulth data? And how many corpus parts were there for both corpora?</li>
<li>p. 116: I am not sure it makes a lot of sense to report a statistical significance test for the hypotheses that the medians of the flexibility values are not 0 when Figure 4.6 and 4.7 show that 3 of the 4 medians are in fact 0;</li>
<li>p. 116: “When lexical items in English and Nuuchahnulth exhibit flexibility, it is typically not to a marginal degree. A stem is more likely to have a flexibility of, say, .200 than something like .002.” → “When lexical items in English and Nuuchahnulth exhibit flexibility, it is typically not to a marginal degree; items with a flexibility &gt;0 are more likely to have a flexibility of, say, .200 than something like .002.”;</li>
<li>p. 117f.: how does the above statement (“A stem is more likely to have a flexibility of, say, .200 than something like .002.”) fit with “Beginning with English, we can see that most lexical items exhibit some flexibility, but to a relatively small degree. After zero-flexibility cases, the <em>next most frequent flexibility rating</em> is in the 0–0.05 range.” (my emphasis). I know it’s maybe mathematically possible that both statements are true, but it certainly doesn’t sound intuitive.</li>
<li>p. 119: This discussion emphasizes how Nuuchahnulth has so much flexibility along the reference-predication axis, ok, but doesn’t the left panel of Figure 4.8 suggest a similar degree of flexibility along the reference-modification axis for English? This doesn’t seem to discussed much in comparison.</li>
<li>Section 4.4 discusses the cuulative growth curves of the flexibility values. That is generally a good idea and something very similar is often done for vocabulary growth curves etc. to quantify lexical diversity, <em>but</em> in such studies one does not, like Danny, make much of the one growth curve of the corpus but resamples the corpus multiple times (100? 1000?) and plots all the growth curves on top of each other to see what the ‘confidence interval’ of the curve is. This is because in just about all corpora, the order of the corpus parts is arbitrary so the one ordering Danny computed his curves on does not permit much in terms of conclusions. The erratic ups and downs characteristic of the current curves will be smoothed out, leading to much more interpretable results.</li>
<li>Section 4.5: I wrote to Danny about this now that I’ve re-run the analyses. There’s a mistake in two of the models and the code he sent me doesn’t replicate the results he’s reported. (He didn’t run any of this by me at the time he did this so I am seeing these things for the first time myself.) The main problem of this section is that the results are probably the worst I’ve ever seen on actual data: the regression models explain <em>extremely</em> little. I am not saying that’s Danny’s fault – it may just be that the correlations he’s exploring are really non-existent. What I am saying is that that Section needs to say that more clearly. He doesn’t report <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> or explained deviances for the each of the 4 models, the one deviance he reports I cannot replicate, and while he says “There is so much variability in the data for English that no firm conclusions can be drawn.”, this is just understating the ‘awfulness’ of the results (and this section as well as p. 145 discusses the significant findings for Nuuchahnulth in a way that inflates their predictive power). Someone who doesn’t know statistics and doesn’t re-run the analyses but only reads this chapter has no idea that the four models are so weak that they border on ‘uninterpretable’ (in fact, I am uncertain whether to even recommend deleting the graphs, they don’t really say anything. given the numerical results Danny is not showing but that I see whe I run the data). Not his fault, probably, but needs to be disclosed more for a non-statistical audience. p: 142f.: this seems to misrepresent the findings: “It was found that the overwhelming majority of English stems exhibit some degree of flexibility. That degree of flexibility is generally small (∼ 0.2), but not so small as to be statistically insignificant.” First, the statistics reported arund p. 117 etc. showed clearly that the median flexibility value in 3 of the 4 samples was actually 0. Second, that’s why I above said we don’t need/want a significance test that the median is not 0.</li>
