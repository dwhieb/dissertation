# Q: Does frequency correlate with degree of flexibility?
# Hypothesis: Yes, archlexemes that are more frequent are more flexible.
# Note: Frequency here refers to observed relative frequency per 1,000 words.
# Note: Despite the directional hypothesis, this is a two-tailed test.
# There is no principled reason for ruling out in advance the possibility
# that the direction of correlation could be negative.
# H0: Frequency and flexibility do not correlate.
# H1: Frequency and flexibility correlate.
