# Examples

Suffix migration can happen when a lexical suffix has semantic scope over the phrase.

Mood suffixes also show migratory behavior. Person suffixes are often fused with mood suffixes, but can occur alone. Person suffixes must always occur on the main predicate.

Aspectual suffixes do _not_ show migratory behavior. (Lexical suffixes seem to be inserted  between roots and aspectual suffixes? Toshi’s grammar isn’t clear.)

It seems like there’s some variability as to the ordering of the aspectual and lexical affixes.
